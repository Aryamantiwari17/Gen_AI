I\\'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A SHOW CALLED \"THE LAST OF US\" ON HBO. FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT\\'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I\\'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I\\'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT\\'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY\\'RE VERY PROUD OF ME. I KNOW THEY\\'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN\\'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN\\'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN\\'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE\\'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. COLDPLAY IS HERE, SO STICK')]"

      "Speech:Sure, here is a summary of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's \"My Vision for India\" speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in his visionary speech \"My Vision for India,\" outlines his aspirations for the nation's future. He emphasizes the importance of education, innovation, and a strong work ethic in transforming India into a developed country. Kalam envisions India as a nation where every citizen has access to quality education and healthcare, and where technology plays a crucial role in national development. He highlights the need for unity among diverse communities and the importance of ethical values. Kalam also stresses the role of youth in driving change and urges them to take responsibility for building a better future. His vision is rooted in the principles of self-reliance, hard work, and a collective effort towards progress. Ultimately, Kalam's vision is for an India that is prosperous, self-reliant, and respected globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this speech, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam emphasizes the power of dreaming and its transformative effect on actions. He begins by repeating the word \"dream,\" highlighting the importance of dreaming as a catalyst for thoughts and actions. Kalam's quote underscores the idea that dreams, when nurtured, evolve into thoughts and subsequently drive actions, which ultimately lead to tangible outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also provides a brief background on Kalam himself. Born in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu, to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Imam, and Ashiamma, a housewife, Kalam was the youngest of five children. He is renowned as the ‘Missile Man of India’ for his significant contributions to the development of ballistic missile technology. Kalam served as the President of India from 2002 to 2007 and is widely recognized as one of India's most distinguished scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is one of Kalam's most popular and influential addresses, in which he urges Indians to take responsibility for the future of India and calls for a change in their approach and actions to ensure a better tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech titled \"My Vision for India,\" former Indian President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam outlines his vision for India to become a developed nation. He emphasizes three key visions: first, transforming India into a developed country; second, making India self-reliant and self-sufficient; and third, ensuring India becomes a global leader in technology and innovation. Kalam underscores the importance of individual and collective responsibility in achieving these goals. He encourages every citizen to fulfill their duties and contribute to building a stronger and more prosperous India. The speech is a call to action, motivating people to work together towards these aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam articulated three key visions for India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Freedom**: This vision emphasizes the need for individual and national independence, likely referring to both political and intellectual freedom.\n",
      "2. **Development**: This vision focuses on the progress and growth of the nation, encompassing economic, social, and technological advancements.\n",
      "3. **Standing Up to the World**: This vision calls for India to assert its presence and influence on the global stage, highlighting the importance of a strong and respected position in the international community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes India's historic resilience and peaceful nature, highlighting that while India has faced invasions, it has never initiated aggression against others. It points out that India's First War of Independence was in 1857, and underscores the importance of safeguarding this independence to maintain respect and sovereignty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the positive economic growth of India, with a 10% GDP growth rate and a declining poverty rate. Despite this progress, Dr. Kalam observes that Indians often do not see themselves as a self-reliant group. He aspires for India to be a developed nation rather than just a developing one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes that India needs to assert itself globally to earn respect. It argues that only strength respects strength, and India must be robust both militarily and economically, as these two aspects should complement each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summarized version of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam's career had four significant milestones:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Project Director for India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3.**\n",
      "2. **Successful mission of Agni in 1994.**\n",
      "3. **Partnership between DRDO and the Department of Atomic Energy.**\n",
      "4. **Developing lightweight (300-gram) callipers to replace heavy metallic ones, alleviating pain for children with disabilities.**\n",
      "\n",
      "These achievements highlight Dr. Kalam's contributions to India's space program, defense, and healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam criticizes the Indian media for its focus on negative news, such as failures and disasters, instead of highlighting positive achievements. He uses the example of Dr. Sudarshan, who transformed a tribal village into a self-sustaining unit, to illustrate that there are many inspiring stories of success in India. He contrasts this with the media in Tel Aviv, where despite frequent violence and conflict, a newspaper chose to feature a positive story about an individual who turned desert land into a productive farm, inspiring readers. Dr. Kalam suggests that the Indian media should adopt a similar approach to motivate and uplift the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam expresses surprise and concern over the nation's strong desire for foreign products, such as TVs, shirts, and technology. He points out that there is a significant obsession with imported items. According to him, true self-respect can only be achieved through self-reliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech criticizes the double standards of Indians who adhere to rules and maintain cleanliness in foreign countries but fail to do the same in India. The speaker highlights that Indians often blame the government, laws, and municipalities for problems in India, but do not take personal responsibility for their actions. The speaker contrasts this behavior with the strict adherence to rules and regulations observed in countries like Singapore, Washington, and Tokyo by the same Indians. The core message is a call for Indians to be as conscientious and respectful citizens in their own country as they are when abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech critiques societal attitudes about government responsibility and personal accountability. It argues that people often expect the government to solve problems without taking personal responsibility. For instance, people expect the government to clean up litter but do not bother to pick up trash themselves. Similarly, people expect clean public facilities but do not use them properly. Regarding social issues, people make public declarations of support but do not follow through with their actions at home. Overall, the speech emphasizes the need for personal accountability and responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a common tendency to blame negative actions or shortcomings on the broader \"system,\" which is perceived as everything and everyone else except for oneself and immediate family. The speaker criticizes this approach, noting that when it comes to making positive contributions, people often retreat into a protective bubble, expecting a savior-like figure to miraculously fix problems, or they opt to leave the country. The underlying message is that this mindset of dependence and avoidance is unproductive and that individual responsibility and action are essential for meaningful change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech critiques individuals who flee their own country to live in others, seeking stability and prosperity wherever it's available. It highlights a pattern of jumping from one country to another (from America to England, and then to the Gulf) whenever the current host country faces instability or economic hardship. The speaker accuses these individuals of being lazy and cowardly, avoiding their own country's challenges and instead burdening the systems of other nations. They also criticize those who, when in crisis, expect their home country (India) to rescue them, rather than supporting their own country's development. The speech concludes by suggesting that people's priorities are misplaced, as they prioritize personal gain (money) over contributing to their own country's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam concludes his speech by quoting J.F. Kennedy's famous words and applying them to India, saying, \"Ask what we can do for India and do what has to be done to make India what America and other Western countries are today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech, titled \"Thank You,\" seems to be a brief and simple expression of gratitude. The summary is:\n",
      "\n",

      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's \"My Vision For India\" is a visionary speech outlining his aspirations for India's future and his call to action for the nation's progress. Delivered by India’s former President, the speech focuses on his three key visions for India to become a developed nation. Kalam, affectionately known as the 'Missile Man of India' for his pioneering work in ballistic missile technology, served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. A distinguished scientist and inspiring speaker, Kalam's vision emphasizes the responsibility of every Indian in building a stronger nation. The speech aims to motivate the country's youth and enhance educational standards, ultimately empowering the nation for a prosperous future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam articulated his vision for India through three primary goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **FREEDOM**: This vision emphasizes the importance of individual and collective liberty, encouraging every Indian to strive for personal and national freedom. Kalam recalls how India, throughout its history, has been repeatedly looted by invaders. However, India has never invaded any country, reflecting its respect for the freedom of others. He highlights the significance of the 1857 First War of Independence and the subsequent achievement of independence, underscoring the need to protect this hard-won freedom, which is crucial for national respect and standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **DEVELOPMENT**: This vision centers on the need for comprehensive development across all sectors, including technology, economy, and social welfare, to elevate India's standing on the global stage. Kalam acknowledged that while India is growing economically and the rate of poverty is declining, with a healthy GDP growth rate of 10%, he observed that Indians have yet to see themselves as a group of self-reliant people. He aspires for India to be a developed nation, not just a developing one. Notably, Kalam highlights his career milestones, including being the project director for India’s first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3, and the successful mission of Agni in 1994, which were pivotal in India's technological and defense advancements. Additionally, his work in replacing heavy metallic callipers with lighter ones to alleviate the suffering of children with polio underscores his commitment to societal welfare and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **INDIA MUST STAND UP TO THE WORLD**: This vision calls for India to assert itself as a global leader, capable of making significant contributions to the world community and capable of handling challenges on the international front with confidence and competence. Kalam emphasizes that unless India stands up to the world, it will not be respected. He advocates for India to be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power, with both aspects complementing each other. This strength, he believes, will ensure that India is respected and can contribute meaningfully to the global community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Dr. Kalam expressed his concern and surprise at the nation's obsession with foreign things. He observed that there is a widespread desire for imported items such as foreign TVs, shirts, and technology, highlighting a tendency to favor everything that is imported. Kalam firmly believes that self-respect can only come with self-reliance. He emphasizes the importance of valuing and utilizing India's own resources and innovations to build a stronger, more self-sufficient nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech, Dr. Kalam also expressed his disappointment with the media's tendency to focus on negative news, failures, and disasters, rather than highlighting the countless achievements and successes within the country. He cited the example of Dr. Sudarshan, who transformed a tribal village into a self-sustaining, self-reliant unit, among millions of similar achievements in India. Kalam believes that such stories of progress and innovation should be given more prominence to inspire and motivate the nation. He also mentioned an inspiring example from Tel Aviv, where a newspaper featured a story of a man who transformed a desert land into a thriving orchard and granary, illustrating how positive news can uplift a community's spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam also highlighted a significant observation about the behavior of Indians. He noted that while Indians often blame the government, laws, and municipalities for inefficiencies, they consistently conform to rules and systems in foreign countries. He pointed out that Indians who would never litter or speed in countries like Singapore or Washington frequently engage in such behaviors upon returning to India. This discrepancy, he argued, underscores the need for personal responsibility and a sense of civic duty.

The whole system has to change, we seem to justify. For us, the system consists of everyone else except me and you. When it comes to making a positive contribution to the system, we lock ourselves along with our families into a safe cocoon and wait for a Mr. Clean to come along and work miracles for us, or we leave the country and run away.
