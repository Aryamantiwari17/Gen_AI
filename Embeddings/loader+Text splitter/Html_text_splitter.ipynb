An Athenian citizen of high status, he displays in his\\nworks his absorption in the political events and intellectual\\nmovements of his time, but the questions he raises are so profound and\\nthe strategies he uses for tackling them so richly suggestive and\\nprovocative that educated readers of nearly every period have in some\\nway been influenced by him, and in practically every age there have\\nbeen philosophers who count themselves Platonists in some important\\nrespects. He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word\\n“philosopher” should be applied. But he was so\\nself-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its\\nscope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the\\nintellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of\\nphilosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic\\nexamination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological\\nissues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his\\ninvention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy\\napproximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who\\nstudied with him), Aquinas, and Kant would be generally agreed to be\\nof the same rank.  \\nEntry Contents \\n \\n Entry Contents  \\n1.

Plato’s central doctrines  \\nMany people associate Plato with a few central doctrines that are\\nadvocated in his writings: The world that appears to our senses is in\\nsome way defective and filled with error, but there is a more real and\\nperfect realm, populated by entities (called “forms” or\\n“ideas”) that are eternal, changeless, and in some sense\\nparadigmatic for the structure and character of the world presented to\\nour senses. Among the most important of these abstract objects (as\\nthey are now called, because they are not located in space or time)\\nare goodness, beauty, equality, bigness, likeness, unity, being,\\nsameness, difference, change, and changelessness. (These\\nterms—“goodness”, “beauty”, and so\\non—are often capitalized by those who write about Plato, in\\norder to call attention to their exalted status; similarly for\\n“Forms” and “Ideas.”) The most fundamental\\ndistinction in Plato’s philosophy is between the many observable\\nobjects that appear beautiful (good, just, unified, equal, big) and\\nthe one object that is what beauty (goodness, justice, unity) really\\nis, from which those many beautiful (good, just, unified, equal, big)\\nthings receive their names and their corresponding characteristics.\\nNearly every major work of Plato is, in some way, devoted to or\\ndependent on this distinction. Many of them explore the ethical and\\npractical consequences of conceiving of reality in this bifurcated\\nway. We are urged to transform our values by taking to heart the\\ngreater reality of the forms and the defectiveness of the corporeal\\nworld. We must recognize that the soul is a different sort of object\\nfrom the body—so much so that it does not depend on the\\nexistence of the body for its functioning, and can in fact grasp the\\nnature of the forms far more easily when it is not encumbered by its\\nattachment to anything corporeal. In a few of Plato’s works, we\\nare told that the soul always retains the ability to recollect what it\\nonce grasped of the forms, when it was disembodied prior to its\\npossessor’s birth (see especially  ), and that the\\nlives we lead are to some extent a punishment or reward for choices we\\nmade in a previous existence (see especially the final pages of\\n ). But in many of Plato’s writings, it is\\nasserted or assumed that true philosophers—those who recognize\\nhow important it is to distinguish the one (the one thing that\\ngoodness is, or virtue is, or courage is) from the many (the many\\nthings that are called good or virtuous or courageous )—are in a\\nposition to become ethically superior to unenlightened human beings,\\nbecause of the greater degree of insight they can acquire. To\\nunderstand which things are good and why they are good (and if we are\\nnot interested in such questions, how can we become good?), we must\\ninvestigate the form of good.  \\nMeno  \\nRepublic  \\n2. Plato’s puzzles  \\nAlthough these propositions are often identified by Plato’s\\nreaders as forming a large part of the core of his philosophy, many of\\nhis greatest admirers and most careful students point out that few, if\\nany, of his writings can accurately be described as mere advocacy of a\\ncut-and-dried group of propositions. Often Plato’s works exhibit\\na certain degree of dissatisfaction and puzzlement with even those\\ndoctrines that are being recommended for our consideration. For\\nexample, the forms are sometimes described as hypotheses (see for\\nexample  ). The form of good in particular is described\\nas something of a mystery whose real nature is elusive and as yet\\nunknown to anyone at all ( ). Puzzles are\\nraised—and not overtly answered—about how   of\\nthe forms can be known and how we are to talk about them without\\nfalling into contradiction ( ), or about what it is\\nto know anything ( ) or to name anything\\n( ). When one compares Plato with some of the other\\nphilosophers who are often ranked with him—Aristotle, Aquinas,\\nand Kant, for example—he can be recognized to be far more\\nexploratory, incompletely systematic, elusive, and playful than they.\\nThat, along with his gifts as a writer and as a creator of vivid\\ncharacter and dramatic setting, is one of the reasons why he is often\\nthought to be the ideal author from whom one should receive\\none’s introduction to philosophy. His readers are not presented\\nwith an elaborate system of doctrines held to be so fully worked out\\nthat they are in no need of further exploration or development;\\ninstead, what we often receive from Plato is a few key ideas together\\nwith a series of suggestions and problems about how those ideas are to\\nbe interrogated and deployed. Readers of a Platonic dialogue are drawn\\ninto thinking for themselves about the issues raised, if they are to\\nlearn what the dialogue itself might be thought to say about them.\\nMany of his works therefore give their readers a strong sense of\\nphilosophy as a living and unfinished subject (perhaps one that can\\nnever be completed) to which they themselves will have to contribute.\\nAll of Plato’s works are in some way meant to leave further work\\nfor their readers, but among the ones that most conspicuously fall\\ninto this category are:  ,  ,\\n ,  ,  , and\\n .  \\nPhaedo  \\nRepublic  \\nany  \\nParmenides  \\nTheaetetus  \\nCratylus  \\nEuthyphro  \\nLaches  \\nCharmides  \\nEuthydemus  \\nTheaetetus  \\nParmenides  \\n3. Dialogue, setting, character  \\nThere is another feature of Plato’s writings that makes him\\ndistinctive among the great philosophers and colors our experience of\\nhim as an author. Nearly everything he wrote takes the form of a\\ndialogue. (There is one striking exception: his  ,\\nwhich purports to be the speech that Socrates gave in his\\ndefense—the Greek word   means\\n“defense”—when, in 399, he was legally charged and\\nconvicted of the crime of impiety. However, even there, Socrates is\\npresented at one point addressing questions of a philosophical\\ncharacter to his accuser, Meletus, and responding to them. In\\naddition, since antiquity, a collection of 13 letters has been\\nincluded among his collected works, but their authenticity as\\ncompositions of Plato is not universally accepted among scholars, and\\nmany or most of them are almost certainly not his (see Burnyeat and\\nFrede 2015). Most of them purport to be the outcome of his involvement\\nin the politics of Syracuse, a heavily populated Greek city located in\\nSicily and ruled by tyrants.)  \\nApology  \\napologia  \\nWe are of course familiar with the dialogue form through our\\nacquaintance with the literary genre of drama. But Plato’s\\ndialogues do not try to create a fictional world for the purposes of\\ntelling a story, as many literary dramas do; nor do they invoke an\\nearlier mythical realm, like the creations of the great Greek\\ntragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Nor are they all\\npresented in the form of a drama: in many of them, a single speaker\\nnarrates events in which he participated. They are philosophical\\ndiscussions—“debates” would, in some cases, also be\\nan appropriate word—among a small number of interlocutors, many\\nof whom can be identified as real historical figures (see Nails 2002);\\nand often they begin with a depiction of the setting of the\\ndiscussion—a visit to a prison, a wealthy man’s house, a\\ncelebration over drinks, a religious festival, a visit to the\\ngymnasium, a stroll outside the city’s wall, a long walk on a\\nhot day. As a group, they form vivid portraits of a social world, and\\nare not purely intellectual exchanges between characterless and\\nsocially unmarked speakers. (At any rate, that is true of a large\\nnumber of Plato’s interlocutors. However, it must be added that\\nin some of his works the speakers display little or no character. See,\\nfor example,   and  —dialogues\\nin which a visitor from the town of Elea in Southern Italy leads the\\ndiscussion; and  , a discussion between an unnamed\\nAthenian and two named fictional characters, one from Crete and the\\nother from Sparta.) In   of his dialogues (though not\\nall), Plato is not only attempting to draw his readers into a\\ndiscussion, but is also commenting on the social milieu that he is\\ndepicting, and criticizing the character and ways of life of his\\ninterlocutors (see Blondell 2002). Some of the dialogues that most\\nevidently fall into this category are  ,\\n ,  ,  , and\\n .  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nLaws  \\nmany  \\nProtagoras  \\nGorgias  \\nHippias Major  \\nEuthydemus  \\nSymposium  \\n4. Socrates  \\nThere is one interlocutor who speaks in nearly all of Plato’s\\ndialogues, being completely absent only in  , which\\nancient testimony tells us was one of his latest works: that figure is\\nSocrates. Like nearly everyone else who appears in Plato’s\\nworks, he is not an invention of Plato: there really was a Socrates\\njust as there really was a Crito, a Gorgias, a Thrasymachus, and a\\nLaches. Plato was not the only author whose personal experience of\\nSocrates led to the depiction of him as a character in one or more\\ndramatic works. Socrates is one of the principal characters of\\nAristophanes’ comedy,  ; and Xenophon, a historian\\nand military leader, wrote, like Plato, both an   of\\nSocrates (an account of Socrates’ trial) and other works in\\nwhich Socrates appears as a principal speaker. Furthermore, we have\\nsome fragmentary remains of dialogues written by other contemporaries\\nof Socrates besides Plato and Xenophon (Aeschines, Antisthenes,\\nEucleides, Phaedo), and these purport to describe conversations he\\nconducted with others (see Boys-Stone and Rowe 2013). So, when Plato\\nwrote dialogues that feature Socrates as a principal speaker, he was\\nboth contributing to a genre that was inspired by the life of Socrates\\nand participating in a lively literary debate about the kind of person\\nSocrates was and the value of the intellectual conversations in which\\nhe was involved. Aristophanes’ comic portrayal of Socrates is at\\nthe same time a bitter critique of him and other leading intellectual\\nfigures of the day (the 420s B.C.), but from Plato, Xenophon, and the\\nother composers (in the 390’s and later) of “Socratic\\ndiscourses” (as Aristotle calls this body of writings) we\\nreceive a far more favorable impression.  \\nLaws  \\nClouds  \\nApology  \\nEvidently, the historical Socrates was the sort of person who provoked\\nin those who knew him, or knew of him, a profound response, and he\\ninspired many of those who came under his influence to write about\\nhim. But the portraits composed by Aristophanes, Xenophon, and Plato\\nare the ones that have survived intact, and they are therefore the\\nones that must play the greatest role in shaping our conception of\\nwhat Socrates was like. Of these,   has the least value\\nas an indication of what was distinctive of Socrates’ mode of\\nphilosophizing: after all, it is not intended as a philosophical work,\\nand although it may contain a few lines that are characterizations of\\nfeatures unique to Socrates, for the most part it is an attack on a\\nphilosophical type—the long-haired, unwashed, amoral\\ninvestigator into abstruse phenomena—rather than a depiction of\\nSocrates himself. Xenophon’s depiction of Socrates, whatever its\\nvalue as historical testimony (which may be considerable), is\\ngenerally thought to lack the philosophical subtlety and depth of\\nPlato’s. At any rate, no one (certainly not Xenophon himself)\\ntakes Xenophon to be a major philosopher in his own right; when we\\nread his Socratic works, we are not encountering a great philosophical\\nmind. But that is what we experience when we read Plato. We may read\\nPlato’s Socratic dialogues because we are (as Plato evidently\\nwanted us to be) interested in who Socrates was and what he stood for,\\nbut even if we have little or no desire to learn about the historical\\nSocrates, we will want to read Plato because in doing so we are\\nencountering an author of the greatest philosophical significance. No\\ndoubt he in some way borrowed in important ways from Socrates, though\\nit is not easy to say where to draw the line between him and his\\nteacher (more about this below in section 12). But it is widely agreed\\namong scholars that Plato is not a mere transcriber of the words of\\nSocrates (any more than Xenophon or the other authors of Socratic\\ndiscourses). His use of a figure called “Socrates” in so\\nmany of his dialogues should not be taken to mean that Plato is merely\\npreserving for a reading public the lessons he learned from his\\nteacher.  \\nClouds  \\n5. Plato’s indirectness  \\nSocrates, it should be kept in mind, does not appear in all of\\nPlato’s works. He makes no appearance in  , and\\nthere are several dialogues ( ,  ,\\n ) in which his role is small and peripheral, while\\nsome other figure dominates the conversation or even, as in the\\n  and  , presents a long and elaborate,\\ncontinuous discourse of their own. Plato’s dialogues are not a\\nstatic literary form; not only do his topics vary, not only do his\\nspeakers vary, but the role played by questions and answers is never\\nthe same from one dialogue to another. ( , for\\nexample, is a series of speeches, and there are also lengthy speeches\\nin  ,  ,  ,\\n ,  ,  , and\\n ; in fact, one might reasonably question whether these\\nworks are properly called dialogues). But even though Plato constantly\\nadapted “the dialogue form” (a commonly used term, and\\nconvenient enough, so long as we do not think of it as an unvarying\\nunity) to suit his purposes, it is striking that throughout his career\\nas a writer he never engaged in a form of composition that was widely\\nused in his time and was soon to become the standard mode of\\nphilosophical address: Plato never became a writer of philosophical\\ntreatises, even though the writing of treatises (for example, on\\nrhetoric, medicine, and geometry) was a common practice among his\\npredecessors and contemporaries. (The closest we come to an exception\\nto this generalization is the seventh letter, which contains a brief\\nsection in which the author, Plato or someone pretending to be him,\\ncommits himself to several philosophical points—while insisting,\\nat the same time, that no philosopher will write about the deepest\\nmatters, but will communicate his thoughts only in private discussion\\nwith selected individuals. As noted above, the authenticity of\\nPlato’s letters is a matter of great controversy; and in any\\ncase, the author of the seventh letter declares his opposition to the\\nwriting of philosophical books. Whether Plato wrote it or not, it\\ncannot be regarded as a philosophical treatise, and its author did not\\nwish it to be so regarded.) In all of his writings—except in the\\nletters, if any of them are genuine—Plato never speaks to his\\naudience directly (see Frede 1992) and in his own voice. Strictly\\nspeaking, he does not himself affirm anything in his dialogues;\\nrather, it is the interlocutors in his dialogues who are made by Plato\\nto do all of the affirming, doubting, questioning, arguing, and so on.\\nWhatever he wishes to communicate to us is conveyed indirectly.  \\nLaws  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nTimaeus  \\nTimaeus  \\nCritias  \\nSymposium  \\nApology  \\nMenexenus  \\nProtagoras  \\nCrito  \\nPhaedrus  \\nTimaeus  \\nCritias  \\n6. Can we know Plato’s mind?  \\nThis feature of Plato’s works raises important questions about\\nhow they are to be read, and has led to considerable controversy among\\nthose who study his writings. Since he does not himself affirm\\nanything in any of his dialogues, can we ever be on secure ground in\\nattributing a philosophical doctrine to him (as opposed to one of his\\ncharacters)? Did he himself have philosophical convictions, and can we\\ndiscover what they were? Are we justified in speaking of “the\\nphilosophy of Plato”? Or, if we attribute some view to Plato\\nhimself, are we being unfaithful to the spirit in which he intended\\nthe dialogues to be read? Is his whole point, in refraining from\\nwriting treatises, to discourage the readers of his works from asking\\nwhat their author believes and to encourage them instead simply to\\nconsider the plausibility or implausibility of what his characters are\\nsaying? Is that why Plato wrote dialogues? If not for this reason,\\nthen what   his purpose in refraining from addressing his\\naudience in a more direct way (see Griswold 1988, Klagge and Smith\\n1992, Press 2002)? There are other important questions about the\\nparticular shape his dialogues take: for example, why does Socrates\\nplay such a prominent role in so many of them, and why, in some of\\nthese works, does Socrates play a smaller role, or none at all?  \\nwas  \\nOnce these questions are raised and their difficulty acknowledged, it\\nis tempting, in reading Plato’s works and reflecting upon them,\\nto adopt a strategy of extreme caution. Rather than commit oneself to\\nany hypothesis about what he is trying to communicate to his readers,\\none might adopt a stance of neutrality about his intentions, and\\nconfine oneself to talking only about what is said by his\\n   . One cannot be faulted, for\\nexample, if one notes that, in Plato’s  ,\\nSocrates argues that justice in the soul consists in each part of the\\nsoul doing its own. It is equally correct to point out that other\\nprincipal speakers in that work, Glaucon and Adeimantus, accept the\\narguments that Socrates gives for that definition of justice. Perhaps\\nthere is no need for us to say more—to say, for example, that\\nPlato himself agrees that this is how justice should be defined, or\\nthat Plato himself accepts the arguments that Socrates gives in\\nsupport of this definition. And we might adopt this same\\n“minimalist” approach to   of Plato’s\\nworks. After all, is it of any importance to discover what went on\\ninside his head as he wrote—to find out whether he himself\\nendorsed the ideas he put in the mouths of his characters, whether\\nthey constitute “the philosophy of Plato”? Should we not\\nread his works for their intrinsic philosophical value, and not as\\ntools to be used for entering into the mind of their author? We know\\nwhat Plato’s characters say—and isn’t that all that\\nwe need, for the purpose of engaging with his works\\nphilosophically?  \\ndramatis  \\npersonae  \\nRepublic  \\nall  \\nBut the fact that we know what Plato’s characters  \\ndoes not show that by refusing to entertain any hypotheses about what\\nthe author of these works is trying to communicate to his readers we\\ncan understand what those characters   by what they say.\\nWe should not lose sight of this obvious fact: it is Plato, not any of\\nhis  , who is reaching out to a readership\\nand trying to influence their beliefs and actions by means of his\\nliterary actions. When we ask whether an argument put forward by a\\ncharacter in Plato’s works should be read as an effort to\\npersuade us of its conclusion, or is better read as a revelation of\\nhow foolish that speaker is, we are asking about what  \\nas author (not that character) is trying to lead us to believe,\\nthrough the writing that he is presenting to our attention. We need to\\ninterpret the work itself to find out what it, or Plato the author, is\\nsaying. Similarly, when we ask how a word that has several different\\nsenses is best understood, we are asking what Plato means to\\ncommunicate to us through the speaker who uses that word. We should\\nnot suppose that we can derive much philosophical value from\\nPlato’s writings if we refuse to entertain any thoughts about\\nwhat use he intends us to make of the things his speakers say.\\nPenetrating the mind of Plato and comprehending what his interlocutors\\nmean by what they say are not two separate tasks but one, and if we do\\nnot ask what his interlocutors mean by what they say, and what the\\ndialogue itself indicates we should think about what they mean, we\\nwill not profit from reading his dialogues.  \\nsay  \\nmean  \\ndramatis personae  \\nPlato  \\nFurthermore, the dialogues have certain characteristics that are most\\neasily explained by supposing that Plato is using them as vehicles for\\ninducing his readers to become convinced (or more convinced than they\\nalready are) of certain propositions—for example, that there are\\nforms, that the soul is not corporeal, that knowledge can be acquired\\nonly by means of a study of the forms, and so on. Why, after all, did\\nPlato write so many works (for example:  ,\\n ,  ,  ,\\n ,  ,  ,\\n ,  ,  ) in which one\\ncharacter dominates the conversation (often, but not always, Socrates)\\nand convinces the other speakers (at times, after encountering initial\\nresistance) that they should accept or reject certain conclusions, on\\nthe basis of the arguments presented? The only plausible way of\\nanswering that question is to say that these dialogues were intended\\nby Plato to be devices by which he might induce the audience for which\\nthey are intended to reflect on and accept the arguments and\\nconclusions offered by his principal interlocutor. (It is noteworthy\\nthat in  , the principal speaker—an unnamed visitor\\nfrom Athens—proposes that laws should be accompanied by\\n“preludes” in which their philosophical basis is given as\\nfull an explanation as possible. The educative value of written texts\\nis thus explicitly acknowledged by Plato’s dominant speaker. If\\npreludes can educate a whole citizenry that is prepared to learn from\\nthem, then surely Plato thinks that other sorts of written\\ntexts—for example, his own dialogues—can also serve an\\neducative function.)  \\nPhaedo  \\nSymposium  \\nRepublic  \\nPhaedrus  \\nTheaetetus  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nTimaeus  \\nPhilebus  \\nLaws  \\nLaws  \\nThis does not mean that Plato thinks that his readers can become wise\\nsimply by reading and studying his works. On the contrary, it is\\nhighly likely that he wanted all of his writings to be supplementary\\naids to philosophical conversation: in one of his works, he has\\nSocrates warn his readers against relying solely on books, or taking\\nthem to be authoritative. They are, Socrates says, best used as\\ndevices that stimulate the readers’ memory of discussions they\\nhave had (  274e-276d). In those face-to-face\\nconversations with a knowledgeable leader, positions are taken,\\narguments are given, and conclusions are drawn. Plato’s\\nwritings, he implies in this passage from  , will work\\nbest when conversational seeds have already been sown for the\\narguments they contain.  \\nPhaedrus  \\nPhaedrus  \\n7. Socrates as the dominant speaker  \\nIf we take Plato to be trying to persuade us, in many of his works, to\\naccept the conclusions arrived at by his principal interlocutors (or\\nto persuade us of the refutations of their opponents), we can easily\\nexplain why he so often chooses Socrates as the dominant speaker in\\nhis dialogues. Presumably the contemporary audience for whom Plato was\\nwriting included many of Socrates’ admirers. They would be\\npredisposed to think that a character called “Socrates”\\nwould have all of the intellectual brilliance and moral passion of the\\nhistorical person after whom he is named (especially since Plato often\\nmakes special efforts to give his “Socrates” a life-like\\nreality, and has him refer to his trial or to the characteristics by\\nwhich he was best known); and the aura surrounding the character\\ncalled “Socrates” would give the words he speaks in the\\ndialogue considerable persuasive power. Furthermore, if Plato felt\\nstrongly indebted to Socrates for many of his philosophical techniques\\nand ideas, that would give him further reason for assigning a dominant\\nrole to him in many of his works. (More about this in section 12.)  \\nOf course, there are other more speculative possible ways of\\nexplaining why Plato so often makes Socrates his principal speaker.\\nFor example, we could say that Plato was trying to undermine the\\nreputation of the historical Socrates by writing a series of works in\\nwhich a figure called “Socrates” manages to persuade a\\ngroup of naïve and sycophantic interlocutors to accept absurd\\nconclusions on the basis of sophistries. But anyone who has read some\\nof Plato’s works will quickly recognize the utter implausibility\\nof that alternative way of reading them. Plato could have written into\\nhis works clear signals to the reader that the arguments of Socrates\\ndo not work, and that his interlocutors are foolish to accept them.\\nBut there are many signs in such works as  ,\\n ,  , and   that point\\nin the opposite direction. (And the great admiration Plato feels for\\nSocrates is also evident from his  .) The reader is\\ngiven every encouragement to believe that the reason why Socrates is\\nsuccessful in persuading his interlocutors (on those occasions when he\\ndoes succeed) is that his arguments are powerful ones. The reader, in\\nother words, is being encouraged by the author to accept those\\narguments, if not as definitive then at least as highly arresting and\\ndeserving of careful and full positive consideration. When we\\ninterpret the dialogues in this way, we cannot escape the fact that we\\nare entering into the mind of Plato, and attributing to him, their\\nauthor, a positive evaluation of the arguments that his speakers\\npresent to each other.  \\nMeno  \\nPhaedo  \\nRepublic  \\nPhaedrus  \\nApology  \\n8. Links between the dialogues  \\nThere is a further reason for entertaining hypotheses about what Plato\\nintended and believed, and not merely confining ourselves to\\nobservations about what sorts of people his characters are and what\\nthey say to each other. When we undertake a serious study of Plato,\\nand go beyond reading just one of his works, we are inevitably\\nconfronted with the question of how we are to link the work we are\\ncurrently reading with the many others that Plato composed.\\nAdmittedly, many of his dialogues make a fresh start in their setting\\nand their interlocutors: typically, Socrates encounters a group of\\npeople many of whom do not appear in any other work of Plato, and so,\\nas an author, he needs to give his readers some indication of their\\ncharacter and social circumstances. But often Plato’s characters\\nmake statements that would be difficult for readers to understand\\nunless they had already read one or more of his other works. For\\nexample, in   (73a-b), Socrates says that one argument\\nfor the immortality of the soul derives from the fact that when people\\nare asked certain kinds of questions, and are aided with diagrams,\\nthey answer in a way that shows that they are not learning afresh from\\nthe diagrams or from information provided in the questions, but are\\ndrawing their knowledge of the answers from within themselves. That\\nremark would be of little worth for an audience that had not already\\nread  . Several pages later, Socrates tells his\\ninterlocutors that his argument about our prior knowledge of equality\\nitself (the form of equality) applies no less to other forms—to\\nthe beautiful, good, just, pious and to all the other things that are\\ninvolved in their asking and answering of questions (75d). This\\nreference to asking and answering questions would not be well\\nunderstood by a reader who had not yet encountered a series of\\ndialogues in which Socrates asks his interlocutors questions of the\\nform, “What is X?” ( : what is piety?\\n : what is courage?  : What is\\nmoderation?  : what is beauty? see Dancy 2004).\\nEvidently, Plato is assuming that readers of   have\\nalready read several of his other works, and will bring to bear on the\\ncurrent argument all of the lessons that they have learned from them.\\nIn some of his writings, Plato’s characters refer ahead to the\\ncontinuation of their conversations on another day, or refer back to\\nconversations they had recently: thus Plato signals to us that we\\nshould read  ,  , and\\n  sequentially; and similarly, since the opening of\\n  refers us back to  , Plato is\\nindicating to his readers that they must seek some connection between\\nthese two works.  \\nPhaedo  \\nMeno  \\nEuthyphro  \\nLaches  \\nCharmides  \\nHippias Major  \\nPhaedo  \\nTheaetetus  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nTimaeus  \\nRepublic  \\nThese features of the dialogues show Plato’s awareness that he\\ncannot entirely start from scratch in every work that he writes. He\\nwill introduce new ideas and raise fresh difficulties, but he will\\nalso expect his readers to have already familiarized themselves with\\nthe conversations held by the interlocutors of other\\ndialogues—even when there is some alteration among those\\ninterlocutors. (Meno does not re-appear in  ; Timaeus\\nwas not among the interlocutors of  .) Why does Plato\\nhave his dominant characters (Socrates, the Eleatic visitor) reaffirm\\nsome of the same points from one dialogue to another, and build on\\nideas that were made in earlier works? If the dialogues were merely\\nmeant as provocations to thought—mere exercises for the\\nmind—there would be no need for Plato to identify his leading\\ncharacters with a consistent and ever-developing doctrine. For\\nexample, Socrates continues to maintain, over a large number of\\ndialogues, that there are such things as forms—and there is no\\nbetter explanation for this continuity than to suppose that Plato is\\nrecommending that doctrine to his readers. Furthermore, when Socrates\\nis replaced as the principal investigator by the visitor from Elea (in\\n  and  ), the existence of forms\\ncontinues to be taken for granted, and the visitor criticizes any\\nconception of reality that excludes such incorporeal objects as souls\\nand forms. The Eleatic visitor, in other words, upholds a metaphysics\\nthat is, in many respects, like the one that Socrates is made to\\ndefend. Again, the best explanation for this continuity is that Plato\\nis using both characters—Socrates and the Eleatic\\nvisitor—as devices for the presentation and defense of a\\ndoctrine that he embraces and wants his readers to embrace as\\nwell.  \\nPhaedo  \\nRepublic  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\n9. Does Plato change his mind about forms?  \\nThis way of reading Plato’s dialogues does not presuppose that\\nhe never changes his mind about anything—that whatever any of\\nhis main interlocutors uphold in one dialogue will continue to be\\npresupposed or affirmed elsewhere without alteration. It is, in fact,\\na difficult and delicate matter to determine, on the basis of our\\nreading of the dialogues, whether Plato means to modify or reject in\\none dialogue what he has his main interlocutor affirm in some other.\\nOne of the most intriguing and controversial questions about his\\ntreatment of the forms, for example, is whether he concedes that his\\nconception of those abstract entities is vulnerable to criticism; and,\\nif so, whether he revises some of the assumptions he had been making\\nabout them, or develops a more elaborate picture of them that allows\\nhim to respond to that criticism (see Meinwald 2016). In\\n , the principal interlocutor (not Socrates—he\\nis here portrayed as a promising, young philosopher in need of further\\ntraining—but rather the pre-Socratic from Elea who gives the\\ndialogue its name: Parmenides) subjects the forms to withering\\ncriticism, and then consents to conduct an inquiry into the nature of\\noneness that has no overt connection to his critique of the forms.\\nDoes the discussion of oneness (a baffling series of\\ncontradictions—or at any rate, propositions that seem, on the\\nsurface, to be contradictions) in some way help address the problems\\nraised about forms? That is one way of reading the dialogue. And if we\\ndo read it in this way, does that show that Plato has changed his mind\\nabout some of the ideas about forms he inserted into earlier\\ndialogues? Can we find dialogues in which we encounter a “new\\ntheory of forms”—that is, a way of thinking of forms that\\ncarefully steers clear of the assumptions about forms that led to\\nParmenides’ critique? It is not easy to say. But we cannot even\\nraise this as an issue worth pondering unless we presuppose that\\nbehind the dialogues there stands a single mind that is using these\\nwritings as a way of hitting upon the truth, and of bringing that\\ntruth to the attention of others. If we find Timaeus (the principal\\ninterlocutor of the dialogue named after him) and the Eleatic visitor\\nof the   and   talking about forms in\\na way that is entirely consistent with the way Socrates talks about\\nforms in   and  , then there is only one\\nreasonable explanation for that consistency: Plato believes that their\\nway of talking about forms is correct, or is at least strongly\\nsupported by powerful considerations. If, on the other hand, we find\\nthat Timaeus or the Eleatic visitor talks about forms in a way that\\ndoes not harmonize with the way Socrates conceives of those abstract\\nobjects, in the dialogues that assign him a central role as director\\nof the conversation, then the most plausible explanation for these\\ndiscrepancies is that Plato has changed his mind about the nature of\\nthese entities. It would be implausible to suppose that Plato himself\\nhad no convictions about forms, and merely wants to give his readers\\nmental exercise by composing dialogues in which different leading\\ncharacters talk about these objects in discordant ways.  \\nParmenides  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nPhaedo  \\nRepublic  \\n10. Does Plato change his mind about politics?  \\nThe same point—that we must view the dialogues as the product of\\na single mind, a single philosopher, though perhaps one who changes\\nhis mind—can be made in connection with the politics of\\nPlato’s works (see Bobonich 2002).  \\nIt is noteworthy, to begin with, that Plato is, among other things, a\\n  philosopher. For he gives expression, in several of\\nhis writings (particular  ), to a yearning to escape\\nfrom the tawdriness of ordinary human relations. (Similarly, he\\nevinces a sense of the ugliness of the sensible world, whose beauty\\npales in comparison with that of the forms.) Because of this, it would\\nhave been all too easy for Plato to turn his back entirely on\\npractical reality, and to confine his speculations to theoretical\\nquestions. Some of his works—  is a stellar\\nexample—do confine themselves to exploring questions that seem\\nto have no bearing whatsoever on practical life. But it is remarkable\\nhow few of his works fall into this category. Even the highly abstract\\nquestions raised in   about the nature of being and\\nnot-being are, after all, embedded in a search for the definition of\\nsophistry; and thus they call to mind the question whether Socrates\\nshould be classified as a sophist—whether, in other words,\\nsophists are to be despised and avoided. In any case, despite the\\ngreat sympathy Plato expresses for the desire to shed one’s body\\nand live in an incorporeal world, he devotes an enormous amount of\\nenergy to the task of understanding the world we live in, appreciating\\nits limited beauty, and improving it.  \\npolitical  \\nPhaedo  \\nParmenides  \\nSophist  \\nHis tribute to the mixed beauty of the sensible world, in\\n , consists in his depiction of it as the outcome of\\ndivine efforts to mold reality in the image of the forms, using simple\\ngeometrical patterns and harmonious arithmetic relations as building\\nblocks. The desire to transform human relations is given expression in\\na far larger number of works. Socrates presents himself, in\\nPlato’s  , as a man who does not have his head in\\nthe clouds (that is part of Aristophanes’ charge against him in\\n ). He does not want to escape from the everyday world\\nbut to make it better (see Allen 2010). He presents himself, in\\n , as the only Athenian who has tried his hand at the\\ntrue art of politics.  \\nTimaeus  \\nApology  \\nClouds  \\nGorgias  \\nSimilarly, the Socrates of   devotes a considerable\\npart of his discussion to the critique of ordinary social\\ninstitutions—the family, private property, and rule by the many.\\nThe motivation that lies behind the writing of this dialogue is the\\ndesire to transform (or, at any rate, to improve) political life, not\\nto escape from it (although it is acknowledged that the desire to\\nescape is an honorable one: the best sort of rulers greatly prefer the\\ncontemplation of divine reality to the governance of the city). And if\\nwe have any further doubts that Plato does take an interest in the\\npractical realm, we need only turn to  . A work of such\\ngreat detail and length about voting procedures, punishments,\\neducation, legislation, and the oversight of public officials can only\\nhave been produced by someone who wants to contribute something to the\\nimprovement of the lives we lead in this sensible and imperfect realm.\\nFurther evidence of Plato’s interest in practical matters can be\\ndrawn from his letters, if they are genuine. In most of them, he\\npresents himself as having a deep interest in educating (with the help\\nof his friend, Dion) the ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius II, and thus\\nreforming that city’s politics.  \\nRepublic  \\nLaws  \\nJust as any attempt to understand Plato’s views about forms must\\nconfront the question whether his thoughts about them developed or\\naltered over time, so too our reading of him as a political\\nphilosopher must be shaped by a willingness to consider the\\npossibility that he changed his mind. For example, on any plausible\\nreading of  , Plato evinces a deep antipathy to rule\\nby the many. Socrates tells his interlocutors that the only politics\\nthat should engage them are those of the anti-democratic regime he\\ndepicts as the paradigm of a good constitution. And yet in\\n , the Athenian visitor proposes a detailed legislative\\nframework for a city in which non-philosophers (people who have never\\nheard of the forms, and have not been trained to understand them) are\\ngiven considerable powers as rulers. Plato would not have invested so\\nmuch time in the creation of this comprehensive and lengthy work, had\\nhe not believed that the creation of a political community ruled by\\nthose who are philosophically unenlightened is a project that deserves\\nthe support of his readers. Has Plato changed his mind, then? Has he\\nre-evaluated the highly negative opinion he once held of those who are\\ninnocent of philosophy? Did he at first think that the reform of\\nexisting Greek cities, with all of their imperfections, is a waste of\\ntime—but then decide that it is an endeavor of great value? (And\\nif so, what led him to change his mind?) Answers to these questions\\ncan be justified only by careful attention to what he has his\\ninterlocutors say. But it would be utterly implausible to suppose that\\nthese developmental questions need not be raised, on the grounds that\\n  and   each has its own cast of\\ncharacters, and that the two works therefore cannot come into\\ncontradiction with each other. According to this hypothesis (one that\\nmust be rejected), because it is Socrates (not Plato) who is critical\\nof democracy in  , and because it is the Athenian\\nvisitor (not Plato) who recognizes the merits of rule by the many in\\n , there is no possibility that the two dialogues are in\\ntension with each other. Against this hypothesis, we should say: Since\\nboth   and   are works in which Plato is\\ntrying to move his readers towards certain conclusions, by having them\\nreflect on certain arguments—these dialogues are not barred from\\nhaving this feature by their use of interlocutors—it would be an\\nevasion of our responsibility as readers and students of Plato not to\\nask whether what one of them advocates is compatible with what the\\nother advocates. If we answer that question negatively, we have some\\nexplaining to do: what led to this change? Alternatively, if we\\nconclude that the two works are compatible, we must say why the\\nappearance of conflict is illusory.  \\nRepublic  \\nLaws  \\nRepublic  \\nLaws  \\nRepublic  \\nLaws  \\nRepublic  \\nLaws  \\n11. The historical Socrates: early, middle, and late dialogues  \\nMany contemporary scholars find it plausible that when Plato embarked\\non his career as a philosophical writer, he composed, in addition to\\nhis   of Socrates, a number of short ethical dialogues\\nthat contain little or nothing in the way of positive philosophical\\ndoctrine, but are mainly devoted to portraying the way in which\\nSocrates punctured the pretensions of his interlocutors and forced\\nthem to realize that they are unable to offer satisfactory definitions\\nof the ethical terms they used, or satisfactory arguments for their\\nmoral beliefs. According to this way of placing the dialogues into a\\nrough chronological order—associated especially with Gregory\\nVlastos’s name (see especially his  , chapters 2 and 3)—Plato, at this point\\nof his career, was content to use his writings primarily for the\\npurpose of preserving the memory of Socrates and making plain the\\nsuperiority of his hero, in intellectual skill and moral seriousness,\\nto all of his contemporaries—particularly those among them who\\nclaimed to be experts on religious, political, or moral matters. Into\\nthis category of early dialogues (they are also sometimes called\\n“Socratic” dialogues, possibly without any intended\\nchronological connotation) are placed:  ,\\n ,  ,  ,\\n ,    ,  \\n ,  ,  ,  , and\\n , (Some scholars hold that we can tell which of\\nthese come later during Plato’s early period. For example, it is\\nsometimes said that   and   are\\nlater, because of their greater length and philosophical complexity.\\nOther dialogues—for example,   and\\n —are thought not to be among Plato’s\\nearliest within this early group, because in them Socrates appears to\\nbe playing a more active role in shaping the progress of the dialogue:\\nthat is, he has more ideas of his own.) In comparison with many of\\nPlato’s other dialogues, these “Socratic” works\\ncontain little in the way of metaphysical, epistemological, or\\nmethodological speculation, and they therefore fit well with the way\\nSocrates characterizes himself in Plato’s  : as a\\nman who leaves investigations of high falutin’ matters (which\\nare “in the sky and below the earth”) to wiser heads, and\\nconfines all of his investigations to the question how one should live\\none’s life. Aristotle describes Socrates as someone whose\\ninterests were restricted to only one branch of philosophy—the\\nrealm of the ethical; and he also says that he was in the habit of\\nasking definitional questions to which he himself lacked answers\\n(  987b1,   183b7).\\nThat testimony gives added weight to the widely accepted hypothesis\\nthat there is a group of dialogues—the ones mentioned above as\\nhis early works, whether or not they were all written early in\\nPlato’s writing career—in which Plato used the dialogue\\nform as a way of portraying the philosophical activities of the\\nhistorical Socrates (although, of course, he might also have used them\\nin other ways as well—for example to suggest and begin to\\nexplore philosophical difficulties raised by them, see Santas 1979,\\nBrickhouse and Smith 1994).  \\nApology  \\nSocrates Ironist and\\nMoral Philosopher  \\nCharmides  \\nCrito  \\nEuthydemus  \\nEuthyphro  \\nGorgias  \\nHippias  \\nMajor  \\nHippias  \\nMinor  \\nIon  \\nLaches  \\nLysis  \\nProtagoras  \\nProtagoras  \\nGorgias  \\nCharmides  \\nLysis  \\nApology  \\nMetaphysics  \\nSophistical Refutations  \\nBut at a certain point—so says this hypothesis about the\\nchronology of the dialogues—Plato began to use his works to\\nadvance ideas that were his own creations rather than those of\\nSocrates, although he continued to use the name “Socrates”\\nfor the interlocutor who presented and argued for these new ideas. The\\nspeaker called “Socrates” now begins to move beyond and\\ndepart from the historical Socrates: he has views about the\\nmethodology that should be used by philosophers (a methodology\\nborrowed from mathematics), and he argues for the immortality of the\\nsoul and the existence and importance of the forms of beauty, justice,\\ngoodness, and the like. (By contrast, in   Socrates\\nsays that no one knows what becomes of us after we die.)\\n  is often said to be the dialogue in which Plato first\\ncomes into his own as a philosopher who is moving far beyond the ideas\\nof his teacher (though it is also commonly said that we see a new\\nmethodological sophistication and a greater interest in mathematical\\nknowledge in  ). Having completed all of the dialogues\\nthat, according to this hypothesis, we characterize as early, Plato\\nwidened the range of topics to be explored in his writings (no longer\\nconfining himself to ethics), and placed the theory of forms (and\\nrelated ideas about language, knowledge, and love) at the center of\\nhis thinking. In these works of his “middle”\\nperiod—for example, in  ,  ,\\n ,  , and\\n —there is both a change of emphasis and of\\ndoctrine. The focus is no longer on ridding ourselves of false ideas\\nand self-deceit; rather, we are asked to accept (however tentatively)\\na radical new conception of ourselves (now divided into three parts),\\nour world—or rather, our two worlds—and our need to\\nnegotiate between them. Definitions of the most important virtue terms\\nare finally proposed in   (the search for them in some\\nof the early dialogues having been unsuccessful): Book I of this\\ndialogue is a portrait of how the historical Socrates might have\\nhandled the search for a definition of justice, and the rest of the\\ndialogue shows how the new ideas and tools discovered by Plato can\\ncomplete the project that his teacher was unable to finish. Plato\\ncontinues to use a figure called “Socrates” as his\\nprincipal interlocutor, and in this way he creates a sense of\\ncontinuity between the methods, insights, and ideals of the historical\\nSocrates and the new Socrates who has now become a vehicle for the\\narticulation of his own new philosophical outlook. In doing so, he\\nacknowledges his intellectual debt to his teacher and appropriates for\\nhis own purposes the extraordinary prestige of the man who was the\\nwisest of his time.  \\nApology  \\nPhaedo  \\nMeno  \\nPhaedo  \\nCratylus  \\nSymposium  \\nRepublic  \\nPhaedrus  \\nRepublic  \\nThis hypothesis about the chronology of Plato’s writings has a\\nthird component: it does not place his works into either of only two\\ncategories—the early or “Socratic” dialogues, and\\nall the rest—but works instead with a threefold division of\\nearly, middle, and late. That is because, following ancient testimony,\\nit has become a widely accepted assumption that   is one\\nof Plato’s last works, and further that this dialogue shares a\\ngreat many stylistic affinities with a small group of others:\\n ,  ,  ,\\n , and  . These five dialogues together\\nwith   are generally agreed to be his late works, because\\nthey have much more in common with each other, when one counts certain\\nstylistic features apparent only to readers of Plato’s Greek,\\nthan with any of Plato’s other works. (Computer counts have\\naided these stylometric studies, but the isolation of a group of six\\ndialogues by means of their stylistic commonalities was recognized in\\nthe nineteenth century. See Brandwood 1990, Young 1994.)  \\nLaws  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nTimaeus  \\nCritias  \\nPhilebus  \\nLaws  \\nIt is not at all clear whether there are one or more\\n  affinities among this group of six\\ndialogues—that is, whether the philosophy they contain is\\nsharply different from that of all of the other dialogues. Plato does\\nnothing to encourage the reader to view these works as a distinctive\\nand separate component of his thinking. On the contrary, he links\\n  with   (the conversations they\\npresent have a largely overlapping cast of characters, and take place\\non successive days) no less than   and\\n .   contains, in its opening pages, a\\nreference to the conversation of  —and perhaps\\nPlato is thus signaling to his readers that they should bring to bear\\non   the lessons that are to be drawn from\\n . Similarly,   opens with a reminder\\nof some of the principal ethical and political doctrines of\\n . It could be argued, of course, that when one looks\\nbeyond these stage-setting devices, one finds significant\\nphilosophical changes in the six late dialogues, setting this group\\noff from all that preceded them. But there is no consensus that they\\nshould be read in this way. Resolving this issue requires intensive\\nstudy of the content of Plato’s works. So, although it is widely\\naccepted that the six dialogues mentioned above belong to\\nPlato’s latest period, there is, as yet, no agreement among\\nstudents of Plato that these six form a distinctive stage in his\\nphilosophical development.  \\nphilosophical  \\nSophist  \\nTheaetetus  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nSophist  \\nParmenides  \\nSophist  \\nParmenides  \\nTimaeus  \\nRepublic  \\nIn fact, it remains a matter of dispute whether the division of\\nPlato’s works into three periods—early, middle,\\nlate—does correctly indicate the order of composition, and\\nwhether it is a useful tool for the understanding of his thought (See\\nCooper 1997, vii–xxvii). Of course, it would be wildly\\nimplausible to suppose that Plato’s writing career began with\\nsuch complex works as  ,  ,\\n , or  . In light of widely accepted\\nassumptions about how most philosophical minds develop, it is likely\\nthat when Plato started writing philosophical works some of the\\nshorter and simpler dialogues were the ones he composed:\\n , or  , or   (for example).\\n(Similarly,   does not advance a complex philosophical\\nagenda or presuppose an earlier body of work; so that too is likely to\\nhave been composed near the beginning of Plato’s writing\\ncareer.) Even so, there is no good reason to eliminate the hypothesis\\nthat throughout much of his life Plato devoted himself to writing two\\nsorts of dialogues at the same time, moving back and forth between\\nthem as he aged: on the one hand, introductory works whose primary\\npurpose is to show readers the difficulty of apparently simple\\nphilosophical problems, and thereby to rid them of their pretensions\\nand false beliefs; and on the other hand, works filled with more\\nsubstantive philosophical theories supported by elaborate\\nargumentation. Moreover, one could point to features of many of the\\n“Socratic” dialogues that would justify putting them in\\nthe latter category, even though the argumentation does not concern\\nmetaphysics or methodology or invoke\\nmathematics— ,  ,\\n ,  ,   among\\nthem.  \\nLaws  \\nParmenides  \\nPhaedrus  \\nRepublic  \\nLaches  \\nCrito  \\nIon  \\nApology  \\nGorgias  \\nProtagoras  \\nLysis  \\nEuthydemus  \\nHippias Major  \\nPlato makes it clear that both of these processes, one preceding the\\nother, must be part of one’s philosophical education. One of his\\ndeepest methodological convictions (affirmed in  ,\\n , and  ) is that in order to make\\nintellectual progress we must recognize that knowledge cannot be\\nacquired by passively receiving it from others: rather, we must work\\nour way through problems and assess the merits of competing theories\\nwith an independent mind. Accordingly, some of his dialogues are\\nprimarily devices for breaking down the reader’s complacency,\\nand that is why it is essential that they come to no positive\\nconclusions; others are contributions to theory-construction, and are\\ntherefore best absorbed by those who have already passed through the\\nfirst stage of philosophical development. We should not assume that\\nPlato could have written the preparatory dialogues only at the\\nearliest stage of his career. Although he may well have begun his\\nwriting career by taking up that sort of project, he may have\\ncontinued writing these “negative” works at later stages,\\nat the same time that he was composing his theory-constructing\\ndialogues. For example although both   and\\n  are widely assumed to be early dialogues, they\\nmight have been written around the same time as   and\\n , which are generally assumed to be compositions of\\nhis middle period—or even later.  \\nMeno  \\nTheaetetus  \\nSophist  \\nEuthydemus  \\nCharmides  \\nSymposium  \\nRepublic  \\nNo doubt, some of the works widely considered to be early really are\\nsuch. But it is an open question which and how many of them are. At\\nany rate, it is clear that Plato continued to write in a\\n“Socratic” and “negative” vein even after he\\nwas well beyond the earliest stages of his career:  \\nfeatures a Socrates who is even more insistent upon his ignorance than\\nare the dramatic representations of Socrates in briefer and\\nphilosophically less complex works that are reasonably assumed to be\\nearly; and like many of those early works,   seeks\\nbut does not find the answer to the “what is it?” question\\nthat it relentlessly pursues—“What is knowledge?”\\nSimilarly,  , though certainly not an early\\ndialogue, is a work whose principal aim is to puzzle the reader by the\\npresentation of arguments for apparently contradictory conclusions;\\nsince it does not tell us how it is possible to accept all of those\\nconclusions, its principal effect on the reader is similar to that of\\ndialogues (many of them no doubt early) that reach only negative\\nconclusions. Plato uses this educational device—provoking the\\nreader through the presentation of opposed arguments, and leaving the\\ncontradiction unresolved—in   (often\\nconsidered an early dialogue) as well. So it is clear that even after\\nhe was well beyond the earliest stages of his thinking, he continued\\nto assign himself the project of writing works whose principal aim is\\nthe presentation of unresolved difficulties. (And, just as we should\\nrecognize that puzzling the reader continues to be his aim even in\\nlater works, so too we should not overlook the fact that there is some\\nsubstantive theory-construction in the ethical works that are simple\\nenough to have been early compositions:  , for example,\\naffirms a theory of poetic inspiration; and   sets out\\nthe conditions under which a citizen acquires an obligation to obey\\ncivic commands. Neither ends in failure.)  \\nTheaetetus  \\nTheaetetus  \\nParmenides  \\nProtagoras  \\nIon  \\nCrito  \\nIf we are justified in taking Socrates’ speech in Plato’s\\n  to constitute reliable evidence about what the\\nhistorical Socrates was like, then whatever we find in Plato’s\\nother works that is of a piece with that speech can also be safely\\nattributed to Socrates. So understood, Socrates was a moralist but\\n(unlike Plato) not a metaphysician or epistemologist or cosmologist.\\nThat fits with Aristotle’s testimony, and Plato’s way of\\nchoosing the dominant speaker of his dialogues gives further support\\nto this way of distinguishing between him and Socrates. The number of\\ndialogues that are dominated by a Socrates who is spinning out\\nelaborate philosophical doctrines is remarkably small:\\n ,  ,  , and\\n . All of them are dominated by ethical issues:\\nwhether to fear death, whether to be just, whom to love, the place of\\npleasure. Evidently, Plato thinks that it is appropriate to make\\nSocrates the major speaker in a dialogue that is filled with positive\\ncontent only when the topics explored in that work primarily have to\\ndo with the ethical life of the individual. (The political aspects of\\n  are explicitly said to serve the larger question\\nwhether any individual, no matter what his circumstances, should be\\njust.) When the doctrines he wishes to present systematically become\\nprimarily metaphysical, he turns to a visitor from Elea\\n( ,  ); when they become cosmological,\\nhe turns to Timaeus; when they become constitutional, he turns, in\\n , to a visitor from Athens (and he then eliminates\\nSocrates entirely). In effect, Plato is showing us: although he owes a\\ngreat deal to the ethical insights of Socrates, as well as to his\\nmethod of puncturing the intellectual pretensions of his interlocutors\\nby leading them into contradiction, he thinks he should not put into\\nthe mouth of his teacher too elaborate an exploration of ontological,\\nor cosmological, or political themes, because Socrates refrained from\\nentering these domains. This may be part of the explanation why he has\\nSocrates put into the mouth of the personified Laws of Athens the\\ntheory advanced in  , which reaches the conclusion that\\nit would be unjust for him to escape from prison. Perhaps Plato is\\nindicating, at the point where these speakers enter the dialogue, that\\nnone of what is said here is in any way derived from or inspired by\\nthe conversation of Socrates.  \\nApology  \\nPhaedo  \\nRepublic  \\nPhaedrus  \\nPhilebus  \\nRepublic  \\nSophist  \\nStatesman  \\nLaws  \\nCrito  \\nJust as we should reject the idea that Plato must have made a\\ndecision, at a fairly early point in his career, no longer to write\\none kind of dialogue (negative, destructive, preparatory) and to write\\nonly works of elaborate theory-construction; so we should also\\nquestion whether he went through an early stage during which he\\nrefrained from introducing into his works any of his own ideas (if he\\nhad any), but was content to play the role of a faithful portraitist,\\nrepresenting to his readers the life and thought of Socrates. It is\\nunrealistic to suppose that someone as original and creative as Plato,\\nwho probably began to write dialogues somewhere in his thirties (he\\nwas around 28 when Socrates was killed), would have started his\\ncompositions with no ideas of his own, or, having such ideas, would\\nhave decided to suppress them, for some period of time, allowing\\nhimself to think for himself only later. (What would have led to such\\na decision?) We should instead treat the moves made in the dialogues,\\neven those that are likely to be early, as Platonic\\ninventions—derived, no doubt, by Plato’s reflections on\\nand transformations of the key themes of Socrates that he attributes\\nto Socrates in  . That speech indicates, for example,\\nthat the kind of religiosity exhibited by Socrates was unorthodox and\\nlikely to give offense or lead to misunderstanding. It would be\\nimplausible to suppose that Plato simply concocted the idea that\\nSocrates followed a divine sign, especially because Xenophon too\\nattributes this to his Socrates. But what of the various philosophical\\nmoves rehearsed in  —the dialogue in which\\nSocrates searches, unsuccessfully, for an understanding of what piety\\nis? We have no good reason to think that in writing this work Plato\\nadopted the role of a mere recording device, or something close to it\\n(changing a word here and there, but for the most part simply\\nrecalling what he heard Socrates say, as he made his way to court). It\\nis more likely that Plato, having been inspired by the unorthodoxy of\\nSocrates’ conception of piety, developed, on his own, a series\\nof questions and answers designed to show his readers how difficult it\\nis to reach an understanding of the central concept that\\nSocrates’ fellow citizens relied upon when they condemned him to\\ndeath. The idea that it is important to search for definitions may\\nhave been Socratic in origin. (After all, Aristotle attributes this\\nmuch to Socrates.) But the twists and turns of the arguments in\\n  and other dialogues that search for definitions are\\nmore likely to be the products of Plato’s mind than the content\\nof any conversations that really took place.  \\nApology  \\nEuthyphro  \\nEuthyphro  \\n12. Why dialogues?  \\nIt is equally unrealistic to suppose that when Plato embarked on his\\ncareer as a writer, he made a conscious decision to put all of the\\ncompositions that he would henceforth compose for a general reading\\npublic (with the exception of  ) in the form of a\\ndialogue. If the question, “why did Plato write\\ndialogues?”, which many of his readers are tempted to ask,\\npre-supposes that there must have been some such once-and-for-all\\ndecision, then it is poorly posed. It makes better sense to break that\\nquestion apart into many little ones: better to ask, “Why did\\nPlato write   (for example:\\n , or  , or  , or\\n ) in the form of a dialogue—and   one\\n , say) mostly in the form of a long and\\nrhetorically elaborate single speech?” than to ask why he\\ndecided to adopt the dialogue form.  \\nApology  \\nthis particular work  \\nProtagoras  \\nRepublic  \\nSymposium  \\nLaws  \\nthat  \\n(  \\nTimaeus  \\nThe best way to form a reasonable conjecture about why Plato wrote any\\ngiven work in the form of a dialogue is to ask: what would be lost,\\nwere one to attempt to re-write this work in a way that eliminated the\\ngive-and-take of interchange, stripped the characters of their\\npersonality and social markers, and transformed the result into\\nsomething that comes straight from the mouth of its author? This is\\noften a question that will be easy to answer, but the answer might\\nvary greatly from one dialogue to another. In pursuing this strategy,\\nwe must not rule out the possibility that some of Plato’s\\nreasons for writing this or that work in the form of a dialogue will\\nalso be his reason for doing so in other cases—perhaps some of\\nhis reasons, so far as we can guess at them, will be present in all\\nother cases. For example, the use of character and conversation allows\\nan author to enliven his work, to awaken the interest of his\\nreadership, and therefore to reach a wider audience. The enormous\\nappeal of Plato’s writings is in part a result of their dramatic\\ncomposition. Even treatise-like compositions— \\nand  , for example—improve in readability because of\\ntheir conversational frame. Furthermore, the dialogue form allows\\nPlato’s evident interest in pedagogical questions (how is it\\npossible to learn? what is the best way to learn? from what sort of\\nperson can we learn? what sort of person is in a position to learn?)\\nto be pursued not only in the content of his compositions but also in\\ntheir form. Even in   such questions are not far from\\nPlato’s mind, as he demonstrates, through the dialogue form, how\\nit is possible for the citizens of Athens, Sparta, and Crete to learn\\nfrom each other by adapting and improving upon each other’s\\nsocial and political institutions.  \\nTimaeus  \\nLaws  \\nLaws  \\nIn some of his works, it is evident that one of Plato’s goals is\\nto create a sense of puzzlement among his readers, and that the\\ndialogue form is being used for this purpose. The  \\nis perhaps the clearest example of such a work, because here Plato\\nrelentlessly rubs his readers’ faces in a baffling series of\\nunresolved puzzles and apparent contradictions. But several of his\\nother works also have this character, though to a smaller degree: for\\nexample,   (can virtue be taught?),   (is voluntary wrongdoing better than involuntary\\nwrongdoing?), and portions of   (are some people virtuous\\nbecause of divine inspiration?). Just as someone who encounters\\nSocrates in conversation should sometimes be puzzled about whether he\\nmeans what he says (or whether he is instead speaking ironically), so\\nPlato sometimes uses the dialogue form to create in his readers a\\nsimilar sense of discomfort about what he means and what we ought to\\ninfer from the arguments that have been presented to us. But Socrates\\ndoes not   speak ironically, and similarly Plato’s\\ndialogues do not   aim at creating a sense of bafflement\\nabout what we are to think about the subject under discussion. There\\nis no mechanical rule for discovering how best to read a dialogue, no\\ninterpretive strategy that applies equally well to all of his works.\\nWe will best understand Plato’s works and profit most from our\\nreading of them if we recognize their great diversity of styles and\\nadapt our way of reading accordingly. Rather than impose on our\\nreading of Plato a uniform expectation of what he must be doing\\n(because he has done such a thing elsewhere), we should bring to each\\ndialogue a receptivity to what is unique to it. That would be the most\\nfitting reaction to the artistry in his philosophy.  \\nParmenides  \\nProtagoras  \\nHippias\\nMinor  \\nMeno  \\nalways  \\nalways  \\nBibliography  \\nThe bibliography below is meant as a highly selective and limited\\nguide for readers who want to learn more about the issues covered\\nabove.
