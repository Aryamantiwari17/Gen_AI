This study investigates the effectiveness of LLMs in com -\\nprehending consumer opinions, particularly in service industries . We fine-tuned four prominent LLMs — Falcon- \\n7B, MPT-7B, GPT-2, and BERT — using 1,031,478 consumer reviews and assessed their ability to identify topics, \\nemotions, and sentiments. Our results indicate that Falcon-7B excels in accuracy and reliability for complex \\ntasks. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically for \\nconsumer data, showcasing the efficacy of attention mechanisms in extracting valuable insights. Our findings \\noffer strategic decision-making insights for the service industry and underscore the transformative potential of \\nLLMs in business intelligence from consumer feedback.   \\n1. Introduction \\nIn the evolving service sector, the importance of online consumer \\nreviews cannot be overstated ( Cheung and Lee, 2012 ; Filieri, 2015 ). As \\nthe internet and mobile technologies advance, online reviews have \\nbecome critical for consumers to evaluate the quality of products and \\nservices before purchases, significantly shaping consumer perceptions \\nand decision-making ( Hu et al., 2008 ; Sparks and Browning, 2011 ; Wu \\nand Chang, 2020 ). Rooted in real customer experiences, these reviews \\nare seen as genuine and impartial, thereby influencing purchase de -\\ncisions ( Sparks and Browning, 2011 ). Traditionally, consumers faced \\ndifficulties in assessing service quality without firsthand experience. \\nHowever, online review platforms have facilitated broader access to \\nevaluative information, enabling consumers to make better-informed \\ndecisions based on the experiences shared by others ( Sotiriadis et al., \\n2013 ). \\nOnline reviews manifest in various formats, such as ratings and \\ntextual feedback, with the latter providing a deeper dive into consumers ’ \\nfeelings and choices. Textual reviews in sectors like tourism highlight \\nservice quality, customer contentment, and booking likelihood, aiding \\npotential tourists in making informed choices and reducing purchase \\nrisks ( Utz et al., 2012 ; Mudambi and Schuff, 2010 ). Given the \\nvoluminous nature of online review data, sophisticated technologies \\nsuch as big data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and \\nartificial intelligence (AI) are essential for analysis, surpassing tradi -\\ntional manual techniques ( Kang et al., 2020 ; Rajput, 2020 ). Employing \\nthese technological tools enables thorough mining and examination of \\nonline review content, offering deeper insights into consumer attitudes \\nand preferences. \\nOver the past decade, a major advancement in natural language \\nprocessing (NLP) has been the introduction of transformer architectures \\nby Google scientists, highlighted in the revolutionary work “ Attention is \\nAll You Need ” by Vaswani et al. (2017) . This groundbreaking develop -\\nment addresses the disadvantages of traditional neural network archi -\\ntectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term \\nmemory (LSTM) networks, paving the way for models that rely on \\nself-attention mechanisms. This shift has significantly enhanced the \\ncomputational efficiency of NLP tasks, facilitating the development of \\nlarge language models (LLMs) with extraordinary capabilities ( Devlin \\net al., 2018 ; Brown et al., 2020 ; Kucharavy et al., 2023 ), capable of \\nhandling unstructured, complex textual data such as online customer \\nreviews ( Radford et al., 2019 ). Unlike traditional machine learning \\nmethods, LLMs learn directly from raw text, eliminating the need for \\nmanually crafted features and specialized domain knowledge, as \\n* Corresponding author.

(2019) . This approach enables LLMs to discern the \\nfiner nuances and semantic interrelations within diverse textual \\nlandscapes. \\nPrevious literature in consumer studies predominantly employed \\nBayesian models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Struc -\\ntural Topic Models (STM), for analyzing consumer data ( Blei et al., 2003 ; \\nRoberts et al., 2013 ; Kumar et al., 2023 ; Basu et al., 2024 ; Luong et al., \\n2024 ). However, these frequency-based models often struggle to capture \\nthe intricate and nuanced elements of textual data due to the lack of an \\nattention mechanism, a key feature of modern transformer-based Large \\nLanguage Models (LLMs). This gap has led to a shift towards LLMs, \\nwhich are recognized for their superior ability to understand and \\ngenerate text across various domains ( Radford et al., 2019 ). \\nTransfer learning has become essential for customizing pre-trained \\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for specific domains. In our research, \\nwe employed prompt engineering techniques to fine-tune four \\nLLMs — BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans -\\nformers), Falcon-7B, GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), and \\nMPT-7B (Mosaic Pretrained Transformer-7 billion parameter model) — \\nfor analyzing consumer reviews ( Devlin et al., 2018 ; Almazrouei et al., \\n2023 ; Radford et al., 2019 ; MosaicML NLP Team, 2023 ). Traditionally, \\nmachine learning algorithms like decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and \\nRandom Forest were used in text analytics for their simplicity and ease \\nof interpretation. However, they struggled with capturing semantic re -\\nlationships and contextual nuances in unstructured textual data ( Wang \\nand Wang, 2023; Li et al., 2022 ). Transfer learning enables LLMs to be \\nfine-tuned with domain-specific data, such as consumer reviews from \\nplatforms like TripAdvisor, enhancing their relevance and effectiveness \\n( Devlin et al., 2018 ; Almazrouei et al., 2023 ). Fine-tuning is crucial \\nbecause, while pre-trained LLMs excel at general language under -\\nstanding, they may lack sector-specific expertise. To solidify our theo -\\nretical framework, we delve into the pivotal role of LLMs in modern \\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) research. LLMs, including BERT, \\nFalcon-7B, GPT-2, and MPT-7B, offer substantial improvements over \\ntraditional machine learning algorithms by adeptly capturing complex \\nlinguistic patterns and contextual nuances within unstructured textual \\ndata. Our study innovatively employs prompt engineering techniques to \\nimprove the performance of four leading open-source LLMs — FAL -\\nCON-7B, GPT-2, MPT-7B, and BERT — on consumer feedback, demon -\\nstrating their enhanced capacity to capture consumer sentiment and \\nperception. Our research is guided by the following questions:  \\n1. How does prompt engineering technique affect the performance of \\nfour Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding consumer \\nperception?  \\n2. How can falcon-7B based topic modeling techniques be leveraged to \\nidentify and categorize consumer perceptions across service-based \\nindustries? \\nThis study aims to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of \\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting consumer perceptions \\nthrough detailed experimentation and analysis. The findings from this \\nstudy will offer valuable insights for strategic decision-making and \\npolicy formulation in the service industry. To our knowledge, our study \\nis the first effort to specifically fine-tune LLMs for consumer data, aiming \\nto extract insights from textual data. \\n2. Literature review \\nThis literature review section aims to provide a comprehensive \\noverview of the evolution of sentiment analysis methods, beginning with \\ntraditional rule-based approaches and advancing through machine \\nlearning models to state-of-the-art transformer-based language models. \\nWe will explore the strengths and limitations of each approach, high -\\nlighting the challenges encountered and the strategies employed to \\naddress them. Furthermore, the review will delve into the concept of \\nprompt engineering and its role in enhancing the performance of large \\nlanguage models for domain-specific tasks, such as consumer review \\nanalysis. \\n2.1. Online reviews \\nOnline reviews have become an essential factor in consumer \\ndecision-making processes ( Mudambi and Schuff, 2010 ). Research in -\\ndicates that the likelihood of purchasing a product often increases \\nfollowing recommendations from friends or family, highlighting the \\ninfluence of the recommendation ’ s source ( Djafarova and Rushworth, \\n2017 ). There is a growing trend of consumers relying on the experiences \\nof others, with many turning to online reviews as a key information \\nsource before finalizing their purchases ( O ’ Connor, 2010 ; Kim, 2023 ). In \\nthe hospitality sector, the significance of accommodation reviews ex -\\ntends to shaping a hotel ’ s online reputation, influencing its sales, and \\nimpacting future earnings (\\n¨\\nO ˘güt and Onur Tas ¸ , 2012 ; Torres et al., \\n2015 ). Currently, research on online reviews is primarily focused on \\nsentiment analysis, which involves examining people ’ s emotional re -\\nsponses towards specific products ( Stanca et al., 2023 ). This analysis \\nencompasses identifying feelings of happiness, anger, sadness, joy, \\ncriticism, and praise within the reviews, thereby gauging the product ’ s \\npopularity ( Liu and Zhang, 2012 ). \\n2.2. Sentiment analysis \\nIn the early stages of analyzing consumer reviews, researchers often \\nrelied on dictionary-based methods, where they categorized words, \\nphrases, or sentences based on predefined dictionaries ( Zhang et al., \\n2018 ). These methods were limited in precision, largely because they \\ndepended on the quality of the sentiment lexicons and the rules for \\nsentiment analysis. As data volumes expanded, these approaches \\nstruggled to cope with the increasingly complex demands of text senti -\\nment classification. In natural language processing, rule-based algo -\\nrithms often used established lexicon dictionaries like VADER, \\nTEXTBLOG, AFINN, NRC, and BING ( Ainapure et al., 2023 ). However, \\nthese methods faced challenges, particularly in capturing the nuanced \\ndetails of language ( Gr ´egoire et al., 2014 ). They assigned sentiment \\nscores to individual words without considering context, leading to \\nmisunderstandings, as seen in the mixed review: “ The hotel room was \\njust okay, but the view from the balcony was breathtaking! ” ( Liu, 2017 ). \\nIn the given review, the term ‘just okay ’ might be deemed neutral or \\nslightly negative by a sentiment analysis tool, yet the review ’ s overall \\nsentiment leans positive due to the enthusiastic praise of the view. As \\nsentiment analysis incorporates domain-specific jargon, rule-based \\nmethods face challenges in recognizing nuanced expressions, limiting \\ntheir effectiveness ( Poria et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the burgeoning vol -\\nume of online material poses scalability issues, necessitating regular \\nupdates to the lexicons and potentially straining computational re -\\nsources ( Thelwall et al., 2010 ). The reliance on sentiment dictionaries \\nrequires considerable manual updating, a process that becomes \\nincreasingly laborious and time-consuming with the vast expanse of \\nonline content to analyze ( Taboada et al., 2011 ). \\nThe evolution of machine learning has paved the way for the broader \\napplication of text analysis algorithms, such as Random Forests (RF), \\nXGBoost, Naïve Bayes (NB), and decision trees. These methods identify \\nstatistical patterns in labeled data, which are then applied to predict or \\nclassify new, unseen text ( Pang et al., 2002 ). While they offer improved \\naccuracy compared to dictionary-based approaches, these algorithms \\noften fail to fully grasp the complex semantic connections and contex -\\ntual nuances present in language. Consider the example: “ Although the \\nhotel lobby was clean and modern, the staff seemed indifferent and \\nunhelpful, which did a disservice to the entire experience. ” Here, the \\nsentiment regarding the hotel is mixed; the positive description of the \\nlobby contrasts with the negative feedback about the staff.

Such models may struggle to capture the \\nnuanced complexities of sentiment within context. \\nThe landscape of natural language processing (NLP) has transformed \\ndramatically with advances in deep learning neural networks and \\ntraining methods. Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were \\nutilized to process sequential data like text. Cho et al. (2014) explain \\nhow RNNs process input sequences in a stepwise manner, leveraging \\ninformation from prior steps to make predictions. However, RNNs \\nencounter challenges like vanishing gradients, which impair their ca -\\npacity to maintain long-range dependencies in text data. The concept of \\nvanishing gradients refers to the diminished impact of gradients in the \\ninitial layers of RNNs during training, hindering their ability to preserve \\nand communicate information over long text sequences. \\nTo address the limitations of RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory \\n(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed. \\nHochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) emphasized that LSTM models, \\nequipped with memory cells and gating mechanisms, excel at capturing \\nlong-range dependencies and overcoming the problem of vanishing \\ngradients observed in conventional RNNs. The design of LSTM allows it \\nto effectively handle long-range data, leading to improved computa -\\ntional efficiency. However, challenges with LSTMs include difficulties in \\ninterpretability, as it can be complex to understand the model’s \\ndecision-making process, and a high sensitivity to hyperparameter set -\\ntings. Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) enhance this capability by \\nanalyzing sequences in both forward and reverse directions, thereby \\nimproving the model’s grasp of context. However, the sequential pro -\\ncessing nature of BiLSTMs can result in computational inefficiencies, \\nespecially with longer sequences. On the other hand, later introduced \\nencoder-decoder architectures, while advantageous for tasks like ma -\\nchine translation and text summarization, often encounter challenges in \\nmaintaining contextual information across lengthy sequences. \\nA significant breakthrough in NLP was achieved with the introduc -\\ntion of transformer architectures, as detailed in “Attention is All You \\nNeed” by Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers address the limitations of \\nprevious models by employing self-attention mechanisms, which enable \\nthem to effectively grasp the broader relationships in input sequences. \\nTransformers differ from recurrent architectures in that they process \\ninput data in parallel instead of sequentially as seen as Fig. 3. This \\nparallel processing capability makes transformers highly scalable and \\nefficient in handling long sequences. Moreover, transformers are not \\naffected by the vanishing gradient problem due to their non-reliance on \\nsequential processing. Devlin et al. (2018) introduced BERT (Bidirec -\\ntional Encoder Representations from Transformers), marking a signifi -\\ncant progression in transformer-based NLP models. Subsequent research \\nefforts have been aimed at refining and extending BERT, leading to the \\ndevelopment of variants such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and Dis -\\ntilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019). Each of these versions aims to tackle specific \\nissues or incorporate new strategies to enhance the performance and \\nefficiency of pre-trained language models. \\nThe architecture of BERT consists of multiple encoder layers stacked \\ntogether, with each layer containing self-attention mechanisms and \\nfeed-forward neural networks. This structure enabled BERT to revolu -\\ntionize NLP by delivering state-of-the-art results across various bench -\\nmark tasks, attributed to its capability to derive bidirectional context \\nfrom the text. During preprocessing, BERT’s tokenizer converts input \\ntext into three types of embeddings: token, segment, and positional. \\nDevlin et al. (2018) describe how token embeddings represent individ -\\nual words in a sentence as vectors, segment embeddings distinguish \\ndifferent sentences or segments, and positional embeddings provide \\ninformation about the word positions within the sequence, helping \\nBERT to understand the order of words. \\nEfforts in research have focused on enhancing the adaptability of pre- \\ntrained language models for specific tasks. The paper “Exploring the \\nLimits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer” by \\nRaffel et al. (2020) examines various fine-tuning strategies and their \\neffectiveness across different tasks. Furthermore, research on domain \\nadaptation and zero-shot learning (Xia et al., 2020) aims to enhance the \\ngeneralizability and applicability of models across new domains, \\nrequiring minimal retraining. \\nAs pre-trained language models become larger and more complex, \\nthe importance of efficient training and inference methods becomes \\nincreasingly evident. To reduce the use of computational resources and \\nimprove scalability, researchers are exploring strategies like model \\ncompression, parameter sharing, and hardware optimizations (Good -\\nfellow et al., 2018). The paper “Efficient Transformers: A Survey” by Tay \\net al. (2022) provides comprehensive reviews of techniques aimed at \\nenhancing the efficiency of language models and Transformer archi -\\ntectures. These advancements are not only pivotal in natural language \\nprocessing but also play a significant role in computer vision and rein -\\nforcement learning. \\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-2 \\nand derivatives like Falcon, have revolutionized text generation and \\ncomprehension. By leveraging vast amounts of text data, these models \\nexcel at capturing complex language structures and semantic relation -\\nships. Prompt engineering has emerged as a strategy to enhance the \\nperformance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by crafting tailored \\nprompts for specific tasks or domains (Wahidur et al., 2024). As \\nexplained by Brown et al. (2020), prompt engineering involves crafting \\nprompts that guide the model toward generating desired outputs or \\nperforming specific tasks. Furthermore, tuning pre-trained LLMs with \\ndomain-specific data enhances their efficacy and relevance for partic -\\nular tasks or domains. The advent of open-source Large Language \\nModels (LLMs) such as GPT-2, Falcon-7B, and BERT has democratized \\naccess to sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) models \\nwithin the research and development community. This accessibility \\nempowers researchers and developers to leverage cutting-edge tech -\\nniques without the need for extensive computational resources. \\nIn this study, we selected four open-source Large Language Models \\n(LLMs) - MPT-7B, GPT-2, BERT, for fine-tuning with consumer data. \\nMPT-7B is a versatile LLM capable of handling a wide array of natural \\nlanguage processing tasks. GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer \\n2) is a well-known LLM developed by OpenAI, renowned for its \\nimpressive text generation abilities. On the other hand, Falcon-7B is a \\nnewer LLM that has demonstrated promising performance across \\nvarious text analysis tasks. Using prompt engineering techniques, our \\naim was to enhance the performance of these LLMs in understanding \\nconsumer sentiment and perception. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate \\ntheir performance metrics, with a specific focus on their effectiveness \\nwithin a particular context. \\n3. Research methodology \\n3.1. Data collection and data preprocessing \\nIn this study, our focus was on analyzing consumer reviews due to \\ntheir significant influence on people’s decisions, particularly in the \\ncompetitive hospitality industry. The sample used in our study is \\nrepresentative, sufficiently large, and unbiased, meeting the assump -\\ntions underlying our methodology. We collected consumer reviews from \\nTripAdvisor, a widely used platform for consumer feedback, specifically \\nselecting data from January 2019 to December 2023. This timeframe \\nensured a diverse range of opinions and experiences from a broad de -\\nmographic of consumers in the hospitality sector. Our dataset comprises \\n1,031,478 reviews, evenly split between positive and negative senti -\\nments (515,739 positive and 515,739 negative reviews), ensuring a \\nbalanced representation of sentiments. To extract consumer reviews \\nfrom TripAdvisor’s website, we developed a custom Python crawler. \\nSubsequently, we utilized Python libraries to remove duplicate text and \\nspecial characters. Stop words, including articles and prepositions, were \\neliminated as they lack inherent significance or value for analysis. After \\nremoving stop words, we performed stemming and lemmatization to \\nS.V. Praveen et al.'),\n",

(2024) \\nshowcase the capabilities of LLMs in addressing complex challenges \\nsuch as polarity shifts, open-domain scenarios, and sentiment inference, \\nhighlighting their versatility. ‘Perplexity ’ stands out as a primary metric \\nfor evaluating LLMs, quantifying their predictive accuracy as the expo -\\nnential of the average negative log likelihood per token. This metric \\nreflects the models ’ proficiency in assigning likelihoods based on \\ncontext, serving as a crucial measure of their overall performance: \\nlog ( Perplexity ) = \\x00\\n1\\nN\\n∑\\nN\\ni = 1\\nlog ( P ( token\\ni\\n| context for token\\ni\\n))\\nHere, N denotes the number of tokens in the text corpus, and the \\ndetermination of “ context for token\\ni \\n\" hinges on the specific type of LLM \\nin use. For autoregressive LLMs, the context is the text segment pre -\\nceding token\\ni\\n, while for masked LLMs, it is the text segment sur -\\nrounding token\\ni\\n. Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) typically \\ninvolves examining their perplexity on a distinct test set, comprising \\npreviously unseen data. This practice helps mitigate potential overfitting \\nissues that may arise from training these models on extensive web- \\nscraped corpora. As LLMs continue to evolve, a comprehensive under -\\nstanding of their performance metrics, ethical considerations, and \\nenvironmental impacts becomes paramount for their responsible inte -\\ngration into a diverse range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) ap -\\nplications. In this paper, we delve into three different open-source \\nLLMs — GPT-2, MPT-7B, and Falcon-7B — details of which are elaborated \\nin the upcoming subsections. \\n3.3. Prompt engineering \\nPrompt engineering involves creating specific text instructions or \\ncues to guide generative AI systems, such as large language models \\n(LLMs) like GPT-4, in performing particular tasks. Unlike traditional full \\nfine-tuning methods that directly adjust model parameters, prompt en -\\ngineering focuses on refining prompts to effectively steer the model ’ s \\noutput, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . This approach leverages the inherent \\ncapabilities of LLMs, enabling efficient task adaptation without exten -\\nsive parameter updates. It contrasts with methods like LoRA (Low-Rank \\nAdaptation) ( Hu et al., 2021 ) or PEFT (Parameter-Efficient \\nFine-Tuning), as illustrated in Fig. 2 . The key advantages of prompt \\nengineering lie in its resource efficiency, time effectiveness, and reduced \\ncomplexity compared to fine-tuning techniques. Operating solely on \\nuser input, it significantly reduces computational and memory re -\\nsources, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. \\nAdditionally, it streamlines deployment and iteration cycles, enabling \\nquicker adaptation and experimentation with different task configura -\\ntions. Furthermore, its simplicity at the input level makes it user-friendly \\nfor practitioners without extensive deep learning knowledge, providing \\na straightforward approach to customizing and optimizing tasks. In our \\nstudy, we utilized prompt engineering techniques to fine-tune four \\nprominent open-source LLMs — BERT, GPT-2, MPT-7B, and Fal -\\ncon-7B — using a dataset of 1,031,478 consumer reviews. By leveraging \\nvast amounts of pre-trained data, these models were adapted to under -\\nstand and interpret consumer review data within the hospitality sector. \\nFine-tuning on domain-specific data enhances their ability to accurately \\ninterpret word nuances and semantic meanings, leading to improved \\nperformance. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to demon -\\nstrate the enhanced capacity of fine-tuned LLMs in capturing consumer \\nsentiment and perception, thereby providing valuable insights for stra -\\ntegic decision-making in the service industry. \\nWe used various prompts to evaluate the performance metrics of the \\nmodels and made numerous modifications to the prompts to achieve the \\nhighest possible metrics. This iterative approach involved experiment -\\ning with different types of prompts and incorporating one-shot and few- \\nshot learning techniques to enhance the models ’ ability to understand \\nand generate accurate responses based on limited examples. Perfor -\\nmance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were \\nused to evaluate and refine the models, ensuring their suitability for the \\ntask at hand. \\n3.4. Bidirectional Encoder Representation from transformers (BERT) \\nThe Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers \\n(BERT) is a pre-trained language model that operates on the Trans -\\nformer architecture ( Devlin et al., 2018 ). BERT has demonstrated \\nexceptional performance in natural language processing tasks, particu -\\nlarly in sentiment analysis. On the other hand, Embeddings from Lan -\\nguage Models (ELMo) provide distinct representations for each word in \\nan input sequence by combining intermediate layer representations \\nfrom pre-trained bidirectional long short-term memory networks (See \\nFig. 4 ). These representations are then integrated into existing super -\\nvised models, such as GloVe, for subsequent tasks. While ELMo signifi -\\ncantly enhances various natural language processing tasks, it requires a \\nspecific architecture tailored to each task, which can be challenging to \\nimplement for every NLP task ( Peng et al., 2019 ). In contrast, the \\nGenerative Pre-Training (GPT) model offers a comprehensive frame -\\nwork that is not limited to specific tasks and allows for contextually \\nsensitive representation ( Radford et al., 2018 ). GPT employs the trans -\\nformer decoder and a pre-trained language model to encode and \\nrepresent text sequences. During downstream tasks, the pre-trained \\nmodel ’ s output is fed into an additional linear output layer to make \\nS.V. Praveen et al.'),\n",

Similarly, BERT, also known as Bidirectional Encoder Repre -\\nsentation from Transformers, is effective in various NLP tasks due to its \\nminimal architectural modifications and the use of a pre-trained trans -\\nformer encoder to represent tokens based on bidirectional context \\n( Devlin et al., 2018 ). \\n3.5. Technical concepts \\n3.5.1. Transformer architecture \\nThe Transformer is a groundbreaking neural network architecture \\nintroduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) that incorporates the attention \\nmechanism. This architecture comprises two fundamental components: \\n3.5.2. Transformer ’ s self-attention mechanism \\nThe self-attention mechanism enables the model to simultaneously \\nconsider all positions within the input sequence and compute weights \\nbased on their interrelationships. This mechanism is mathematically \\nrepresented by the following formula: \\nAttention ( Q , K , V ) = softmax\\n(\\nQK\\nT\\n̅̅̅̅ ̅\\nd\\nk\\n√\\n)\\nV  \\nHere, Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, \\nand d\\nk \\nis the dimensionality of the critical vectors. \\n3.5.3. BERT ’ s bidirectional encoder \\nBERT ’ s bidirectional encoder primarily consists of the following \\ncomponents: \\n● Multi-head Self-Attention Encoder: This component utilizes mul -\\ntiple self-attention heads (Multi-head Attention) to capture context \\nrelationships at different levels within the input sequence ( Vaswani \\net al., 2017 ).  \\n● Positional Encoding : To retain positional information in the \\nTransformer sequence, positional encoding employs a one- \\ndimensional periodic sin/cos function encoding scheme.  \\n● Layer Normalization : This normalization technique is crucial for \\nmitigating gradient-related issues such as gradient explosion and \\nvanishing gradients, ensuring stable training of the model ( Xiong \\net al., 2020 ). \\n3.5.4. BERT ’ s pre-training tasks \\nBERT ’ s pre-training tasks primarily comprise the following two \\ntasks:  \\n● Masked Language Modeling (MLM): This task requires BERT to \\npredict the context of masked words. This task can help the model \\nunderstand the relationship between words in context.  \\n● Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT must predict the \\nrelationship between a sentence and its preceding sentence.

Boasting a ten-fold \\nincrease in parameters and training data compared to its predecessor, \\nGPT-2 underwent training on a diverse corpus comprising over 7000 \\nfiction books from BookCorpus and a staggering 8 million web pages \\nfrom WebText.

Despite its impressive capabilities, GPT-2 does have \\noccasional limitations, particularly in generating repetitive or nonsen -\\nsical content in longer texts. Based on the transformer architecture \\nshared with other GPT models, GPT-2 utilizes attention mechanisms to \\nfocus on specific input segments, allowing for efficient parallel pro -\\ncessing ( Fig. 5 ). While GPT-2 played a significant role in advancing \\nlanguage models, newer iterations have surpassed its capabilities. The \\ntransformer architecture used in GPT-2 has become fundamental in \\nnatural language processing, advancing innovation with attention \\nmechanisms and improved parallel processing capabilities. Unlike \\nearlier recurrence- and convolution-based architectures, the transformer \\nmodel ’ s use of attention mechanisms enables selective focus on impor -\\ntant parts of input text, resulting in significant improvements in paral -\\nlelization and surpassing previous benchmarks set by \\nRNN/CNN/LSTM-based models. \\nGPT-2 is fundamentally an autoregressive model. It predicts the next \\nword in a sequence based on the words that came before it. This pre -\\ndiction process iterates until the desired length of text is generated. GPT- \\n2 employs a softmax function to calculate the probability distribution \\nacross the vocabulary for every word in the sequence. \\n3.7.

The contributions made by the MosaicML NLP Team in \\nrefining these architectural elements have resulted in a model that ex -\\ncels in processing large volumes of data with efficiency and reliability, \\nmaking MPT-7B a valuable asset in natural language processing tasks. \\n3.8. Falcon-7B \\nFalcon, a new advancement in language modeling created by the \\nTechnology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, includes a set of state-of- \\nthe-art language models released under the Apache 2.0 license. Notably, \\nFalcon-7B and Falcon-40 B are significant additions to modern language \\nmodels, focusing on inference efficiency by training on extensive data -\\nsets with 1.5 trillion and 1 trillion tokens, respectively. The exceptional \\nquality of the Falcon models originates from their training data, pri -\\nmarily sourced from RefinedWeb, a cutting-edge web dataset built from \\nCommonCrawl. This dataset surpasses traditional curation methods by \\nprioritizing scalability and data quality enhancement through thorough \\ndeduplication and meticulous filtering processes. This rigorous \\napproach strives to meet or exceed the quality standards set by other \\nwell-known corpora. \\nWhile the Falcon models incorporate curated sources like conversa -\\ntional data from platforms such as Reddit, they rely less on such sources \\ncompared to leading language models. One standout feature of the \\nFalcon models is the introduction of multi-query attention, a novel \\nadaptation of the attention mechanism in neural networks ( Fig. 6 ). In \\ntraditional attention mechanisms, each attention head has its query, key, \\nand value components. However, the Falcon models introduce multi- \\nquery attention, where a single key and value are shared across all \\nattention heads, presenting a unique approach to optimizing attention \\nmechanisms ( Almazrouei et al., 2023 ). Mathematically, the concept of \\nmulti-query attention can be represented as follows: \\nMultiQueryAttention ( Q , K , V ) = softmax\\n(\\nQ ( K\\nshared\\n)\\nT\\n̅̅̅̅ ̅\\nd\\nk\\n√\\n)\\nV\\nshared  \\nHere Q represents queries, K\\nshared \\nis the shared key, V denotes values, \\nand V\\nshared \\nrepresents the shared value. This modification enhances the \\nmodels ’ ability to attend to information uniquely and efficiently. \\n3.9. Topic modeling \\nThe abundance of digital content on the Internet, including news \\narticles, social media discussions, and scholarly publications, has posed \\na challenge for researchers to extract valuable insights from large \\ndatasets efficiently. Manual content analysis, a conventional method for \\nextracting information from online reviews, faces obstacles due to labor- \\nintensive processes and scalability limitations ( Krippendorff, 2018 ). \\nResearchers often struggle to identify relevant attributes or summarize \\nparagraphs that capture the core of these extensive datasets. To tackle \\nthese challenges, topic modeling has become a valuable technique for \\nuncovering latent themes within a corpus. Essentially, topic modeling is \\na statistical method that uses unsupervised learning to group the hidden \\nsemantic structure of a corpus. This method helps address issues like \\npolysemy and ambiguity in topic discovery by utilizing traditional \\nclustering algorithms and considering language complexity more fairly, \\nrequiring deeper contextual analysis and adaptability ( Rajput et al., \\n2020 ). Latent semantic indexing (LSI) offers a solution to some of these \\nchallenges but introduces the potential for semantic inaccuracies \\nFig. 5.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation \\n(LDA), introduced by Blei et al. (2003) , addresses these concerns by \\nestimating topic distributions within a corpus based on the \\nco-occurrence probability between words. An extension of LDA known \\nas Structural Topic Modeling (STM) enhances the comprehension of \\ntopic relationships. ( Liu et al., 2022 ; S ´anchez-Franco et al., 2021 ). \\nDespite its advantages, STM requires further refinement to achieve ideal \\nattributes ( Sv and Vijaya, 2024 ). \\nAdvanced techniques like deep learning transformer models, \\nparticularly pre-trained BERT models, play a significant role in text \\nanalysis.

The utilization \\nof transformer-based architectures such as Falcon-7B for topic modeling \\nthrough prompts offers notable advantages in terms of enhanced \\ncontextual understanding, flexibility, and performance ( Almazrouei \\net al., 2023 ). By harnessing the capabilities of these advanced models, \\nresearchers can extract deeper insights from textual data, facilitating \\ninformed decision-making and knowledge discovery across various do -\\nmains, as demonstrated in our study. \\n4. Results and discussions \\nIn this study, we employed four state-of-the-art large language \\nmodels (LLMs) – MPT-7B, GPT-2, Falcon-7B, and BERT – to analyze a \\nmassive dataset of over one million consumer reviews from TripAdvisor. \\nBy leveraging the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs, known for \\ntheir capability to handle vast amounts of data, we trained these LLMs \\non this extensive and diverse dataset. This approach helped mitigate \\npotential biases and ensured a comprehensive representation of con -\\nsumer opinions and experiences. Utilizing cutting-edge LLMs and a large \\ntraining dataset, facilitated by high-performance computing resources, \\nyielded impressive performance metrics. This allowed us to overcome \\nthe limitations of rule-based algorithms, traditional machine learning \\nmodels, and lower-capacity LLMs with fewer parameters, which often \\nresult in less accurate performance metrics. \\n4.1. Performance metrics for sentiment analysis \\nMetrics play a crucial role in evaluating performance and effective -\\nness across diverse domains, including hospitality, tourism, healthcare, \\nand service-based industries. These quantifiable measures offer valuable \\ninsights that aid stakeholders in making informed decisions, identifying \\nareas for enhancement, and monitoring the progress of initiatives or \\nstrategies. \\n4.1.1.

A higher F1 score signifies superior perfor -\\nmance in achieving this balance. According to F1 scores, Falcon leads \\nwith the highest score of 0.91348, showcasing its effectiveness in \\nstriking a balance between precision and recall. However, it ’ s crucial to \\nnote that accuracy, while significant, might not provide the most ac -\\ncurate evaluation for imbalanced datasets. \\nFalcon-7B achieved the highest accuracy scores of 0.914, high -\\nlighting it ’ s overall ability to predict instances accurately. Precision, \\nwhich measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to \\ntotal predicted positive observations, indicates how well the model \\nidentifies positive instances. Falcon-7B exhibits the highest precision \\nscore of 0.91906, closely followed by MPT-7B at 0.89181. \\nRecall, also referred to as sensitivity, assesses how well the model \\ncaptures actual positive instances. Falcon-7B achieves the highest recall \\nscore of 0.914. Considering these metrics collectively, Falcon-7B \\nemerges as the top-performing model among the four, showcasing su -\\nperior performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. \\n4.2. Topic modeling analysis \\nThe comparative analysis between Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) \\nand Falcon-7B LLM offers valuable insights into their respective capa -\\nbilities in topic modeling. LDA employs a probabilistic Bayesian model \\nand word distributions to uncover latent topics in textual data, while \\nFalcon-7B LLM leverages transformer-based architectures and deep \\nlearning techniques to capture semantic relationships. Our topic \\nmodeling results are shown in the Tables 2 and 3 . \\nIn Table 2 , which presents the results from LDA, a notable lack of \\nthematic coherence is evident in the identified topics. For instance, \\nterms like ‘printer ’ in ‘Food Service ’ , ‘lamp ’ in ‘Staff Attitude ’ , ‘didn ’ t ’ in \\n‘Complaint service ’ , ‘cancel ’ in ‘Neighborhood ’ , and ‘perfect ’ in ‘Bath -\\nroom access ’ seem randomly included based solely on word frequency \\nrather than a nuanced understanding of underlying concepts. In the \\n‘Bathroom Access ’ topic, while relevant terms such as ‘sink, ’ ‘heater, ’ \\n‘towel, ’ and ‘tap ’ contribute to discussions on facilities and amenities, \\nthe inclusion of ‘disappoint ’ and ‘wet ’ appears disconnected and lacks \\ncontextual relevance. Similarly, the term ‘perfect ’ in the same category \\nstands out as an outlier, seemingly inserted without a clear connection to \\nthe discussion on bathroom features. These outcomes are consistent with \\nexpectations from LDA ’ s Bayesian probabilistic approach, which relies \\non the likelihood of observing specific words within topics. \\nConversely, Table 3 , displaying the outcomes from Falcon-7B based \\ntopic modeling, showcases well-defined and intuitively sensible topics. \\nThese coherent topics suggest that Falcon LLM, likely owing to its \\ntransformer architecture, can discern relationships between words and \\ngenerate semantically cohesive topics. Furthermore, Falcon-7B LLM \\ndemonstrated superior performance in topics requiring contextual un -\\nderstanding and semantic coherence, such as Front Desk and Overall \\nAtmosphere.

More -\\nover, it highlighted terms like “ friendly, ” “ pleasant, ” and “ professional, ” \\nindicating the expected demeanor and conduct from hospitality \\npersonnel, thereby enriching the overall guest experience. \\nSimilarly, in topics like ‘Safety Fear, ’ which groups words like ‘se -\\ncurity, ’ ‘sanitation, ’ and ‘hazard, ’ and ‘Shower Experience, ’ linking \\nwords like ‘water pressure, ’ ‘temperature, ’ and ‘refreshing, ’ Falcon-7B \\nLLM showcased a depth of understanding in sentiment and tone. For \\ninstance, in the Staff Attitude topic, Falcon-7B LLM highlighted words \\nlike “ friendly, ” “ helpful, ” and “ generous, ” indicating a positive senti -\\nment towards staff behavior. Conversely, in the Service Failure topic, it \\ncaptured words like “ attitude ” and “ rude, ” providing insights into \\nnegative service experiences. \\nBy influencing contextual understanding and semantic coherence, \\nFalcon LLM transcends the limitations of traditional bag-of-words ap -\\nproaches like LDA, allowing for a more insightful interpretation of un -\\nderlying themes within textual data. \\n5. Conclusion \\nIn this research, we investigated the capabilities of state-of-the-art \\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT, MPT-7B, GPT-2, and \\nFalcon-7B for analyzing consumer reviews. Our focus was on sentiment \\nanalysis and topic modeling, utilizing advanced Natural Language Pro -\\ncessing (NLP) techniques to process a substantial volume of unstruc -\\ntured consumer feedback sourced from the TripAdvisor platform. The \\nstudy revealed that LLMs, particularly Falcon-7B, excel at capturing \\ncomplex linguistic patterns and contextual nuances, outperforming \\ntraditional machine learning algorithms and basic NLP methods in un -\\nderstanding consumer data. Precision, recall, and F1 scores for Falcon- \\n7B underscored its superior performance in interpreting consumer sen -\\ntiments. This model ’ s efficiency and capability to capture subtle lan -\\nguage nuances are crucial for businesses aiming to deeply understand \\ncustomer feedback. Our study contributes significantly to the field of \\nNLP and consumer review analysis.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
